1.
Roseto Valfortore lies one hundred miles southeast of Rome in the
Apennine foothills of the Italian province of Foggia. In the style of
medieval villages, the town is organized around a large central square.
Facing the square is the Palazzo Marchesale, the palace of the Saggese
family, once the great landowner of those parts. An archway to one side
leads to a church, the Madonna del Carmine—Our Lady of Mount
Carmine. Narrow stone steps run up the hillside, flanked by closely
clustered two-story stone houses with red-tile roofs.
For centuries, the paesani of Roseto worked in the marble quarries in
the surrounding hills, or cultivated the fields in the terraced valley below,
walking four and five miles down the mountain in the morning and then
making the long journey back up the hill at night. Life was hard. The
townsfolk were barely literate and desperately poor and without much
hope for economic betterment until word reached Roseto at the end of
the nineteenth century of the land of opportunity across the ocean.
In January of 1882, a group of eleven Rosetans—ten men and one
boy—set sail for New York. They spent their first night in America
sleeping on the floor of a tavern on Mulberry Street, in Manhattan’s
Little Italy. Then they ventured west, eventually finding jobs in a slate

quarry ninety miles west of the city near the town of Bangor,
Pennsylvania. The following year, fifteen Rosetans left Italy for
America, and several members of that group ended up in Bangor as well,
joining their compatriots in the slate quarry. Those immigrants, in turn,
sent word back to Roseto about the promise of the New World, and soon
one group of Rosetans after another packed their bags and headed for
Pennsylvania, until the initial stream of immigrants became a flood. In
1894 alone, some twelve hundred Rosetans applied for passports to
America, leaving entire streets of their old village abandoned.
The Rosetans began buying land on a rocky hillside connected to
Bangor by a steep, rutted wagon path. They built closely clustered two-
story stone houses with slate roofs on narrow streets running up and
down the hillside. They built a church and called it Our Lady of Mount
Carmel and named the main street, on which it stood, Garibaldi Avenue,
after the great hero of Italian unification. In the beginning, they called
their town New Italy. But they soon changed it to Roseto, which seemed
only appropriate given that almost all of them had come from the same
village in Italy.
In 1896, a dynamic young priest by the name of Father Pasquale de
Nisco took over at Our Lady of Mount Carmel. De Nisco set up spiritual
societies and organized festivals. He encouraged the townsfolk to clear
the land and plant onions, beans, potatoes, melons, and fruit trees in the
long backyards behind their houses. He gave out seeds and bulbs. The
town came to life. The Rosetans began raising pigs in their backyards
and growing grapes for homemade wine. Schools, a park, a convent, and
a cemetery were built. Small shops and bakeries and restaurants and bars
opened along Garibaldi Avenue. More than a dozen factories sprang up
making blouses for the garment trade. Neighboring Bangor was largely
Welsh and English, and the next town over was overwhelmingly
German, which meant—given the fractious relationships between the
English and Germans and Italians in those years—that Roseto stayed
strictly for Rosetans. If you had wandered up and down the streets of
Roseto in Pennsylvania in the first few decades after 1900, you would
have heard only Italian, and not just any Italian but the precise southern
Foggian dialect spoken back in the Italian Roseto. Roseto, Pennsylvania,
was its own tiny, self-sufficient world—all but unknown by the society
around it—and it might well have remained so but for a man named
Stewart Wolf.

Wolf was a physician. He studied digestion and the stomach and
taught in the medical school at the University of Oklahoma. He spent his
summers on a farm in Pennsylvania, not far from Roseto—although that,
of course, didn’t mean much, since Roseto was so much in its own world
that it was possible to live in the next town and never know much about
it. “One of the times when we were up there for the summer—this would
have been in the late nineteen fifties—I was invited to give a talk at the
local medical society,” Wolf said years later in an interview. “After the
talk was over, one of the local doctors invited me to have a beer. And
while we were having a drink, he said, ‘You know, I’ve been practicing
for seventeen years. I get patients from all over, and I rarely find anyone
from Roseto under the age of sixty-five with heart disease.’ ”
Wolf was taken aback. This was the 1950s, years before the advent of
cholesterol-lowering drugs and aggressive measures to prevent heart
disease. Heart attacks were an epidemic in the United States. They were
the leading cause of death in men under the age of sixty-five. It was
impossible to be a doctor, common sense said, and not see heart disease.
Wolf decided to investigate. He enlisted the support of some of his
students and colleagues from Oklahoma. They gathered together the
death certificates from residents of the town, going back as many years
as they could. They analyzed physicians’ records. They took medical
histories and constructed family genealogies. “We got busy,” Wolf said.
“We decided to do a preliminary study. We started in nineteen sixty-one.
The mayor said, ‘All my sisters are going to help you.’ He had four
sisters. He said, ‘You can have the town council room.’ I said, ‘Where
are you going to have council meetings?’ He said, ‘Well, we’ll postpone
them for a while.’ The ladies would bring us lunch. We had little booths
where we could take blood, do EKGs. We were there for four weeks.
Then I talked with the authorities. They gave us the school for the
summer. We invited the entire population of Roseto to be tested.”
The results were astonishing. In Roseto, virtually no one under fifty-
five had died of a heart attack or showed any signs of heart disease. For
men over sixty-five, the death rate from heart disease in Roseto was
roughly half that of the United States as a whole. The death rate from all
causes in Roseto, in fact, was 30 to 35 percent lower than expected.
Wolf brought in a friend of his, a sociologist from Oklahoma named
John Bruhn, to help him. “I hired medical students and sociology grad
students as interviewers, and in Roseto we went house to house and

talked to every person aged twenty-one and over,” Bruhn remembers.
This happened more than fifty years ago, but Bruhn still had a sense of
amazement in his voice as he described what they found. “There was no
suicide, no alcoholism, no drug addiction, and very little crime. They
didn’t have anyone on welfare. Then we looked at peptic ulcers. They
didn’t have any of those either. These people were dying of old age.
That’s it.”
Wolf’s profession had a name for a place like Roseto—a place that
lay outside everyday experience, where the normal rules did not apply.
Roseto was an outlier.
2.
Wolf’s first thought was that the Rosetans must have held on to some
dietary practices from the Old World that left them healthier than other
Americans. But he quickly realized that wasn’t true. The Rosetans were
cooking with lard instead of with the much healthier olive oil they had
used back in Italy. Pizza in Italy was a thin crust with salt, oil, and
perhaps some tomatoes, anchovies, or onions. Pizza in Pennsylvania was
bread dough plus sausage, pepperoni, salami, ham, and sometimes eggs.
Sweets such as biscotti and taralli used to be reserved for Christmas and
Easter; in Roseto they were eaten year-round. When Wolf had dieticians
analyze the typical Rosetan’s eating habits, they found that a whopping
41 percent of their calories came from fat. Nor was this a town where
people got up at dawn to do yoga and run a brisk six miles. The
Pennsylvanian Rosetans smoked heavily and many were struggling with
obesity.
If diet and exercise didn’t explain the findings, then what about
genetics? The Rosetans were a close-knit group from the same region of
Italy, and Wolf’s next thought was to wonder whether they were of a
particularly hardy stock that protected them from disease. So he tracked
down relatives of the Rosetans who were living in other parts of the
United States to see if they shared the same remarkable good health as
their cousins in Pennsylvania. They didn’t.
He then looked at the region where the Rosetans lived. Was it
possible that there was something about living in the foothills of eastern
Pennsylvania that was good for their health? The two closest towns to
Roseto were Bangor, which was just down the hill, and Nazareth, a few

miles away. These were both about the same size as Roseto, and both
were populated with the same kind of hardworking European
immigrants. Wolf combed through both towns’ medical records. For men
over sixty-five, the death rates from heart disease in Nazareth and
Bangor were three times that of Roseto. Another dead end.
What Wolf began to realize was that the secret of Roseto wasn’t diet
or exercise or genes or location. It had to be Roseto itself. As Bruhn and
Wolf walked around the town, they figured out why. They looked at how
the Rosetans visited one another, stopping to chat in Italian on the street,
say, or cooking for one another in their backyards. They learned about
the extended family clans that underlay the town’s social structure. They
saw how many homes had three generations living under one roof, and
how much respect grandparents commanded. They went to mass at Our
Lady of Mount Carmel and saw the unifying and calming effect of the
church. They counted twenty-two separate civic organizations in a town
of just under two thousand people. They picked up on the particular
egalitarian ethos of the community, which discouraged the wealthy from
flaunting their success and helped the unsuccessful obscure their failures.
In transplanting the paesani culture of southern Italy to the hills of
eastern Pennsylvania, the Rosetans had created a powerful, protective
social structure capable of insulating them from the pressures of the
modern world. The Rosetans were healthy because of where they were
from, because of the world they had created for themselves in their tiny
little town in the hills.
“I remember going to Roseto for the first time, and you’d see three-
generational family meals, all the bakeries, the people walking up and
down the street, sitting on their porches talking to each other, the blouse
mills where the women worked during the day, while the men worked in
the slate quarries,” Bruhn said. “It was magical.”
When Bruhn and Wolf first presented their findings to the medical
community, you can imagine the kind of skepticism they faced. They
went to conferences where their peers were presenting long rows of data
arrayed in complex charts and referring to this kind of gene or that kind
of physiological process, and they themselves were talking instead about
the mysterious and magical benefits of people stopping to talk to one
another on the street and of having three generations under one roof.
Living a long life, the conventional wisdom at the time said, depended to
a great extent on who we were—that is, our genes. It depended on the

decisions we made—on what we chose to eat, and how much we chose
to exercise, and how effectively we were treated by the medical system.
No one was used to thinking about health in terms of community.
Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical establishment to think
about health and heart attacks in an entirely new way: they had to get
them to realize that they wouldn’t be able to understand why someone
was healthy if all they did was think about an individual’s personal
choices or actions in isolation. They had to look beyond the individual.
They had to understand the culture he or she was a part of, and who their
friends and families were, and what town their families came from. They
had to appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the
people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we
are.
In Outliers, I want to do for our understanding of success what
Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health.

CHAPTER ONE
The Matthew Effect
“FOR UNTO EVERYONE THAT HATH SHALL BE GIVEN, AND HE SHALL
HAVE ABUNDANCE. BUT FROM HIM THAT HATH NOT SHALL BE TAKEN
AWAY EVEN THAT WHICH HE HATH.”—MATTHEW 25:29
1.
One warm, spring day in May of 2007, the Medicine Hat Tigers and the
Vancouver Giants met for the Memorial Cup hockey championships in
Vancouver, British Columbia. The Tigers and the Giants were the two
finest teams in the Canadian Hockey League, which in turn is the finest
junior hockey league in the world. These were the future stars of the
sport—seventeen-, eighteen-, and nineteen-year-olds who had been
skating and shooting pucks since they were barely more than toddlers.
The game was broadcast on Canadian national television. Up and
down the streets of downtown Vancouver, Memorial Cup banners hung
from the lampposts. The arena was packed. A long red carpet was rolled
out on the ice, and the announcer introduced the game’s dignitaries. First
came the premier of British Columbia, Gordon Campbell. Then, amid
tumultuous applause, out walked Gordie Howe, one of the legends of the
game. “Ladies and gentlemen,” the announcer boomed. “Mr. Hockey!”
For the next sixty minutes, the two teams played spirited, aggressive
hockey. Vancouver scored first, early in the second period, on a rebound
by Mario Bliznak. Late in the second period, it was Medicine Hat’s turn,
as the team’s scoring leader, Darren Helm, fired a quick shot past
Vancouver’s goalie, Tyson Sexsmith. Vancouver answered in the third
period, scoring the game’s deciding goal, and then, when Medicine Hat
pulled its goalie in desperation, Vancouver scored a third time.
In the aftermath of the game, the players and their families and sports
reporters from across the country crammed into the winning team’s

locker room. The air was filled with cigar smoke and the smell of
champagne and sweat-soaked hockey gear. On the wall was a hand-
painted banner: “Embrace the Struggle.” In the center of the room the
Giants’ coach, Don Hay, stood misty-eyed. “I’m just so proud of these
guys,” he said. “Just look around the locker room. There isn’t one guy
who didn’t buy in wholeheartedly.”
Canadian hockey is a meritocracy. Thousands of Canadian boys begin
to play the sport at the “novice” level, before they are even in
kindergarten. From that point on, there are leagues for every age class,
and at each of those levels, the players are sifted and sorted and
evaluated, with the most talented separated out and groomed for the next
level. By the time players reach their midteens, the very best of the best
have been channeled into an elite league known as Major Junior A,
which is the top of the pyramid. And if your Major Junior A team plays
for the Memorial Cup, that means you are at the very top of the top of
the pyramid.
This is the way most sports pick their future stars. It’s the way soccer
is organized in Europe and South America, and it’s the way Olympic
athletes are chosen. For that matter, it is not all that different from the
way the world of classical music picks its future virtuosos, or the way the
world of ballet picks its future ballerinas, or the way our elite educational
system picks its future scientists and intellectuals.
You can’t buy your way into Major Junior A hockey. It doesn’t matter
who your father or mother is, or who your grandfather was, or what
business your family is in. Nor does it matter if you live in the most
remote corner of the most northerly province in Canada. If you have
ability, the vast network of hockey scouts and talent spotters will find
you, and if you are willing to work to develop that ability, the system
will reward you. Success in hockey is based on individual merit—and
both of those words are important. Players are judged on their own
performance, not on anyone else’s, and on the basis of their ability, not
on some other arbitrary fact.
Or are they?
2.
This is a book about outliers, about men and women who do things that
are out of the ordinary. Over the course of the chapters ahead, I’m going

to introduce you to one kind of outlier after another: to geniuses,
business tycoons, rock stars, and software programmers. We’re going to
uncover the secrets of a remarkable lawyer, look at what separates the
very best pilots from pilots who have crashed planes, and try to figure
out why Asians are so good at math. And in examining the lives of the
remarkable among us—the skilled, the talented, and the driven—I will
argue that there is something profoundly wrong with the way we make
sense of success.
What is the question we always ask about the successful? We want to
know what they’re like—what kind of personalities they have, or how
intelligent they are, or what kind of lifestyles they have, or what special
talents they might have been born with. And we assume that it is those
personal qualities that explain how that individual reached the top.
In the autobiographies published every year by the
billionaire/entrepreneur/rock star/celebrity, the story line is always the
same: our hero is born in modest circumstances and by virtue of his own
grit and talent fights his way to greatness. In the Bible, Joseph is cast out
by his brothers and sold into slavery and then rises to become the
pharaoh’s right-hand man on the strength of his own brilliance and
insight. In the famous nineteenth-century novels of Horatio Alger, young
boys born into poverty rise to riches through a combination of pluck and
initiative. “I think overall it’s a disadvantage,” Jeb Bush once said of
what it meant for his business career that he was the son of an American
president and the brother of an American president and the grandson of a
wealthy Wall Street banker and US senator. When he ran for governor of
Florida, he repeatedly referred to himself as a “self-made man,” and it is
a measure of how deeply we associate success with the efforts of the
individual that few batted an eye at that description.
“Lift up your heads,” Robert Winthrop told the crowd many years
ago at the unveiling of a statue of that great hero of American
independence Benjamin Franklin, “and look at the image of a man who
rose from nothing, who owed nothing to parentage or patronage, who
enjoyed no advantages of early education which are not open—a
hundredfold open—to yourselves, who performed the most menial
services in the businesses in which his early life was employed, but who
lived to stand before Kings, and died to leave a name which the world
will never forget.”

In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal
explanations of success don’t work. People don’t rise from nothing. We
do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand
before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they
are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary
opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work
hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a
difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and
the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our
achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It’s not enough to ask
what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking
where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds
and who doesn’t.
Biologists often talk about the “ecology” of an organism: the tallest
oak in the forest is the tallest not just because it grew from the hardiest
acorn; it is the tallest also because no other trees blocked its sunlight, the
soil around it was deep and rich, no rabbit chewed through its bark as a
sapling, and no lumberjack cut it down before it matured. We all know
that successful people come from hardy seeds. But do we know enough
about the sunlight that warmed them, the soil in which they put down the
roots, and the rabbits and lumberjacks they were lucky enough to avoid?
This is not a book about tall trees. It’s a book about forests—and hockey
is a good place to start because the explanation for who gets to the top of
the hockey world is a lot more interesting and complicated than it looks.
In fact, it’s downright peculiar.

Do you see it? Don’t feel bad if you don’t, because for many years in
the hockey world no one did. It wasn’t until the mid-1980s, in fact, that a
Canadian psychologist named Roger Barnsley first drew attention to the
phenomenon of relative age.
Barnsley was at a Lethbridge Broncos hockey game in southern
Alberta, a team that played in the same Major Junior A league as the

Vancouver Giants and the Medicine Hat Tigers. He was there with his
wife, Paula, and their two boys, and his wife was reading the program,
when she ran across a roster list just like the one above that you just
looked at.
“Roger,” she said, “do you know when these young men were born?”
Barnsley said yes. “They’re all between sixteen and twenty, so they’d
be born in the late sixties.”
“No, no,” Paula went on. “What month.”
“I thought she was crazy,” Barnsley remembers. “But I looked
through it, and what she was saying just jumped out at me. For some
reason, there were an incredible number of January, February, and March
birth dates.”
Barnsley went home that night and looked up the birth dates of as
many professional hockey players as he could find. He saw the same
pattern. Barnsley, his wife, and a colleague, A. H. Thompson, then
gathered statistics on every player in the Ontario Junior Hockey League.
The story was the same. More players were born in January than in any
other month, and by an overwhelming margin. The second most frequent
birth month? February. The third? March. Barnsley found that there were
nearly five and a half times as many Ontario Junior Hockey League
players born in January as were born in November. He looked at the all-
star teams of eleven-year-olds and thirteen-year-olds—the young players
selected for elite traveling squads. Same story. He looked at the
composition of the National Hockey League. Same story. The more he
looked, the more Barnsley came to believe that what he was seeing was
not a chance occurrence but an iron law of Canadian hockey: in any elite
group of hockey players—the very best of the best—40 percent of the
players will have been born between January and March, 30 percent
between April and June, 20 percent between July and September, and 10
percent between October and December.
“In all my years in psychology, I have never run into an effect this
large,” Barnsley says. “You don’t even need to do any statistical analysis.
You just look at it.”
Look back at the Medicine Hat roster. Do you see it now? Seventeen
out of the twenty-five players on the team were born in January,
February, March, or April.
Here is the play-by-play for the first two goals in the Memorial Cup
final, only this time I’ve substituted the players’ birthdays for their

names. It no longer sounds like the championship of Canadian junior
hockey. It now sounds like a strange sporting ritual for teenage boys born
under the astrological signs Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.
March 11 starts around one side of the Tigers’ net, leaving the
puck for his teammate January 4, who passes it to January 22,
who flips it back to March 12, who shoots point-blank at the
Tigers’ goalie, April 27. April 27 blocks the shot, but it’s
rebounded by Vancouver’s March 6. He shoots! Medicine Hat
defensemen February 9 and February 14 dive to block the puck
while January 10 looks on helplessly. March 6 scores!
Let’s go to the second period now.
Medicine Hat’s turn. The Tigers’ scoring leader, January 21,
charges down the right side of the ice. He stops and circles,
eluding the Vancouver defenseman February 15. January 21 then
deftly passes the puck to his teammate December 20—wow!
what’s he doing out there?!—who shrugs off the onrushing
defender May 17 and slides a cross-crease pass back to January
21. He shoots! Vancouver defenseman March 12 dives, trying to
block the shot. Vancouver’s goalie, March 19, lunges helplessly.
January 21 scores! He raises his hands in triumph. His teammate
May 2 jumps on his back with joy.
4.
The explanation for this is quite simple. It has nothing to do with
astrology, nor is there anything magical about the first three months of
the year. It’s simply that in Canada the eligibility cutoff for age-class
hockey is January 1. A boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be
playing alongside someone who doesn’t turn ten until the end of the year
—and at that age, in preadolescence, a twelve-month gap in age
represents an enormous difference in physical maturity.
This being Canada, the most hockey-crazed country on earth, coaches
start to select players for the traveling “rep” squad—the all-star teams—
at the age of nine or ten, and of course they are more likely to view as

talented the bigger and more coordinated players, who have had the
benefit of critical extra months of maturity.
And what happens when a player gets chosen for a rep squad? He
gets better coaching, and his teammates are better, and he plays fifty or
seventy-five games a season instead of twenty games a season like those
left behind in the “house” league, and he practices twice as much as, or
even three times more than, he would have otherwise. In the beginning,
his advantage isn’t so much that he is inherently better but only that he is
a little older. But by the age of thirteen or fourteen, with the benefit of
better coaching and all that extra practice under his belt, he really is
better, so he’s the one more likely to make it to the Major Junior A
league, and from there into the big leagues.*
Barnsley argues that these kinds of skewed age distributions exist
whenever three things happen: selection, streaming, and differentiated
experience. If you make a decision about who is good and who is not
good at an early age; if you separate the “talented” from the
“untalented”; and if you provide the “talented” with a superior
experience, then you’re going to end up giving a huge advantage to that
small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.
In the United States, football and basketball don’t select, stream, and
differentiate quite as dramatically. As a result, a child can be a bit behind
physically in those sports and still play as much as his or her more
mature peers.* But baseball does. The cutoff date for almost all
nonschool baseball leagues in the United States is July 31, with the result
that more major league players are born in August than in any other
month. (The numbers are striking: in 2005, among Americans playing
major league baseball 505 were born in August versus 313 born in July.)
European soccer, similarly, is organized like hockey and baseball—
and the birth-date distributions in that sport are heavily skewed as well.
In England, the eligibility date is September 1, and in the football
association’s premier league at one point in the 1990s, there were 288
players born between September and November and only 136 players
born between June and August. In international soccer, the cutoff date
used to be August 1, and in one recent junior world championship
tournament, 135 players were born in the three months after August 1,
and just 22 were born in May, June, and July. Today the cutoff date for
international junior soccer is January 1. Take a look at the roster of the

2007 Czech National Junior soccer team, which made the Junior World
Cup finals.

At the national team tryouts, the Czech soccer coaches might as well
have told everyone born after midsummer that they should pack their
bags and go home.
Hockey and soccer are just games, of course, involving a select few.
But these exact same biases also show up in areas of much more
consequence, like education. Parents with a child born at the end of the
calendar year often think about holding their child back before the start
of kindergarten: it’s hard for a five-year-old to keep up with a child born
many months earlier. But most parents, one suspects, think that whatever
disadvantage a younger child faces in kindergarten eventually goes away.
But it doesn’t. It’s just like hockey. The small initial advantage that the
child born in the early part of the year has over the child born at the end
of the year persists. It locks children into patterns of achievement and
underachievement, encouragement and discouragement, that stretch on
and on for years.

Recently, two economists—Kelly Bedard and Elizabeth Dhuey—
looked at the relationship between scores on what is called the Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study, or TIMSS (math and
science tests given every four years to children in many countries around
the world), and month of birth. They found that among fourth graders,
the oldest children scored somewhere between four and twelve percentile
points better than the youngest children. That, as Dhuey explains, is a
“huge effect.” It means that if you take two intellectually equivalent
fourth graders with birthdays at opposite ends of the cutoff date, the
older student could score in the eightieth percentile, while the younger
one could score in the sixty-eighth percentile. That’s the difference
between qualifying for a gifted program and not.
“It’s just like sports,” Dhuey said. “We do ability grouping early on in
childhood. We have advanced reading groups and advanced math groups.
So, early on, if we look at young kids, in kindergarten and first grade, the
teachers are confusing maturity with ability. And they put the older kids
in the advanced stream, where they learn better skills; and the next year,
because they are in the higher groups, they do even better; and the next
year, the same thing happens, and they do even better again. The only
country we don’t see this going on is Denmark. They have a national
policy where they have no ability grouping until the age of ten.”
Denmark waits to make selection decisions until maturity differences by
age have evened out.
Dhuey and Bedard subsequently did the same analysis, only this time
looking at college. What did they find? At four-year colleges in the
United States—the highest stream of postsecondary education—students
belonging to the relatively youngest group in their class are
underrepresented by about 11.6 percent. That initial difference in
maturity doesn’t go away with time. It persists. And for thousands of
students, that initial disadvantage is the difference between going to
college—and having a real shot at the middle class—and not.*
“I mean, it’s ridiculous,” Dhuey says. “It’s outlandish that our
arbitrary choice of cutoff dates is causing these long-lasting effects, and
no one seems to care about them.”

Think for a moment about what the story of hockey and early birthdays
says about success.
It tells us that our notion that it is the best and the brightest who
effortlessly rise to the top is much too simplistic. Yes, the hockey players
who make it to the professional level are more talented than you or me.
But they also got a big head start, an opportunity that they neither
deserved nor earned. And that opportunity played a critical role in their
success.
The sociologist Robert Merton famously called this phenomenon the
“Matthew Effect” after the New Testament verse in the Gospel of
Matthew: “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance. But from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.” It is those who are successful, in other words, who are
most likely to be given the kinds of special opportunities that lead to
further success. It’s the rich who get the biggest tax breaks. It’s the best
students who get the best teaching and most attention. And it’s the
biggest nine- and ten-year-olds who get the most coaching and practice.
Success is the result of what sociologists like to call “accumulative
advantage.” The professional hockey player starts out a little bit better
than his peers. And that little difference leads to an opportunity that
makes that difference a bit bigger, and that edge in turn leads to another
opportunity, which makes the initially small difference bigger still—and
on and on until the hockey player is a genuine outlier. But he didn’t start
out an outlier. He started out just a little bit better.
The second implication of the hockey example is that the systems we
set up to determine who gets ahead aren’t particularly efficient. We think
that starting all-star leagues and gifted programs as early as possible is
the best way of ensuring that no talent slips through the cracks. But take
a look again at that roster for the Czech Republic soccer team. There are
no players born in July, October, November, or December, and only one
each in August and September. Those born in the last half of the year
have all been discouraged, or overlooked, or pushed out of the sport. The
talent of essentially half of the Czech athletic population has been
squandered.
So what do you do if you’re an athletic young Czech with the
misfortune to have been born in the last part of the year? You can’t play
soccer. The deck is stacked against you. So maybe you could play the
other sport that Czechs are obsessed with—hockey. But wait. (I think

you know what’s coming.) Here’s the roster of the 2007 Czech junior
hockey team that finished fifth at the world championships.

Those born in the last quarter of the year might as well give up on
hockey too.
Do you see the consequences of the way we have chosen to think
about success? Because we so profoundly personalize success, we miss
opportunities to lift others onto the top rung. We make rules that frustrate
achievement. We prematurely write off people as failures. We are too
much in awe of those who succeed and far too dismissive of those who
fail. And, most of all, we become much too passive. We overlook just
how large a role we all play—and by “we” I mean society—in
determining who makes it and who doesn’t.
If we chose to, we could acknowledge that cutoff dates matter. We
could set up two or even three hockey leagues, divided up by month of
birth. Let the players develop on separate tracks and then pick all-star
teams. If all the Czech and Canadian athletes born at the end of the year
had a fair chance, then the Czech and the Canadian national teams
suddenly would have twice as many athletes to choose from.

Schools could do the same thing. Elementary and middle schools
could put the January through April–born students in one class, the May
through August in another class, and those born in September through
December in the third class. They could let students learn with and
compete against other students of the same maturity level. It would be a
little bit more complicated administratively. But it wouldn’t necessarily
cost that much more money, and it would level the playing field for those
who—through no fault of their own—have been dealt a big disadvantage
by the educational system. We could easily take control of the machinery
of achievement, in other words—not just in sports but, as we will see, in
other more consequential areas as well. But we don’t. And why?
Because we cling to the idea that success is a simple function of
individual merit and that the world in which we all grow up and the rules
we choose to write as a society don’t matter at all.

Before the Memorial Cup final, Gord Wasden—the father of one of the
Medicine Hat Tigers—stood by the side of the ice, talking about his son
Scott. He was wearing a Medicine Hat baseball cap and a black
Medicine Hat T-shirt. “When he was four and five years old,” Wasden
remembered, “his little brother was in a walker, and he would shove a
hockey stick in his hand and they would play hockey on the floor in the
kitchen, morning till night. Scott always had a passion for it. He played
rep hockey throughout his minor-league hockey career. He always made
the Triple A teams. As a first-year peewee or a first-year bantam, he
always played on the [top] rep team.” Wasden was clearly nervous: his
son was about to play in the biggest game of his life. “He’s had to work
very hard for whatever he’s got. I’m very proud of him.”
Those were the ingredients of success at the highest level: passion,
talent, and hard work. But there was another element. When did Wasden
first get the sense that his son was something special? “You know, he
was always a bigger kid for his age. He was strong, and he had a knack
for scoring goals at an early age. And he was always kind of a standout
for his age, a captain of his team….”
Bigger kid for his age? Of course he was. Scott Wasden was born on
January 4, within three days of the absolute perfect birthday for an elite
hockey player. He was one of the lucky ones. If the eligibility date for

Canadian hockey were later in the year, he might have been watching the
Memorial Cup championship from the stands instead of playing on the
ice.

CHAPTER TWO
The 10,000-Hour Rule
“IN HAMBURG, WE HAD TO PLAY FOR EIGHT HOURS.”
1.
The University of Michigan opened its new Computer Center in 1971, in
a brand-new building on Beal Avenue in Ann Arbor, with beige-brick
exterior walls and a dark-glass front. The university’s enormous
mainframe computers stood in the middle of a vast white room, looking,
as one faculty member remembers, “like one of the last scenes in the
movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.” Off to the side were dozens of keypunch
machines—what passed in those days for computer terminals. In 1971,
this was state of the art. The University of Michigan had one of the most
advanced computer science programs in the world, and over the course
of the Computer Center’s life, thousands of students passed through that
white room, the most famous of whom was a gawky teenager named Bill
Joy.
Joy came to the University of Michigan the year the Computer Center
opened. He was sixteen. He was tall and very thin, with a mop of unruly
hair. He had been voted “Most Studious Student” by his graduating class
at North Farmington High School, outside Detroit, which, as he puts it,
meant that he was a “no-date nerd.” He had thought he might end up as
biologist or a mathematician. But late in his freshman year, he stumbled
across the Computer Center—and he was hooked.
From that point on, the Computer Center was his life. He
programmed whenever he could. Joy got a job with a computer science
professor so he could program over the summer. In 1975, he enrolled in
graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley. There, he
buried himself even deeper in the world of computer software. During
the oral exams for his PhD, he made up a particularly complicated

algorithm on the fly that, as one of his many admirers has written, “so
stunned his examiners [that] one of them later compared the experience
to ‘Jesus confounding his elders.’ ”
Working in collaboration with a small group of programmers, Joy
took on the task of rewriting UNIX, which was a software system
developed by AT&T for mainframe computers. Joy’s version was very
good. It was so good, in fact, that it became—and remains—the
operating system on which literally millions of computers around the
world run. “If you put your Mac in that funny mode where you can see
the code,” Joy says, “I see things that I remember typing in twenty-five
years ago.” And do you know who wrote much of the software that
allows you to access the Internet? Bill Joy.
After graduating from Berkeley, Joy cofounded the Silicon Valley
firm Sun Microsystems, which was one of the most critical players in the
computer revolution. There he rewrote another computer language—Java
—and his legend grew still further. Among Silicon Valley insiders, Joy is
spoken of with as much awe as someone like Bill Gates of Microsoft. He
is sometimes called the Edison of the Internet. As the Yale computer
scientist David Gelernter says, “Bill Joy is one of the most influential
people in the modern history of computing.”
The story of Bill Joy’s genius has been told many times, and the
lesson is always the same. Here was a world that was the purest of
meritocracies. Computer programming didn’t operate as an old-boy
network, where you got ahead because of money or connections. It was a
wide-open field in which all participants were judged solely on their
talent and their accomplishments. It was a world where the best men
won, and Joy was clearly one of those best men.
It would be easier to accept that version of events, however, if we
hadn’t just looked at hockey and soccer players. Theirs was supposed to
be a pure meritocracy as well. Only it wasn’t. It was a story of how the
outliers in a particular field reached their lofty status through a
combination of ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage.
Is it possible the same pattern of special opportunities operate in the
real world as well? Let’s go back over the story of Bill Joy and find out.
2.

For almost a generation, psychologists around the world have been
engaged in a spirited debate over a question that most of us would
consider to have been settled years ago. The question is this: is there
such a thing as innate talent? The obvious answer is yes. Not every
hockey player born in January ends up playing at the professional level.
Only some do—the innately talented ones. Achievement is talent plus
preparation. The problem with this view is that the closer psychologists
look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems
to play and the bigger the role preparation seems to play.
Exhibit A in the talent argument is a study done in the early 1990s by
the psychologist K. Anders Ericsson and two colleagues at Berlin’s elite
Academy of Music. With the help of the Academy’s professors, they
divided the school’s violinists into three groups. In the first group were
the stars, the students with the potential to become world-class soloists.
In the second were those judged to be merely “good.” In the third were
students who were unlikely to ever play professionally and who intended
to be music teachers in the public school system. All of the violinists
were then asked the same question: over the course of your entire career,
ever since you first picked up the violin, how many hours have you
practiced?
Everyone from all three groups started playing at roughly the same
age, around five years old. In those first few years, everyone practiced
roughly the same amount, about two or three hours a week. But when the
students were around the age of eight, real differences started to emerge.
The students who would end up the best in their class began to practice
more than everyone else: six hours a week by age nine, eight hours a
week by age twelve, sixteen hours a week by age fourteen, and up and
up, until by the age of twenty they were practicing—that is, purposefully
and single-mindedly playing their instruments with the intent to get
better—well over thirty hours a week. In fact, by the age of twenty, the
elite performers had each totaled ten thousand hours of practice. By
contrast, the merely good students had totaled eight thousand hours, and
the future music teachers had totaled just over four thousand hours.
Ericsson and his colleagues then compared amateur pianists with
professional pianists. The same pattern emerged. The amateurs never
practiced more than about three hours a week over the course of their
childhood, and by the age of twenty they had totaled two thousand hours
of practice. The professionals, on the other hand, steadily increased their

practice time every year, until by the age of twenty they, like the
violinists, had reached ten thousand hours.
The striking thing about Ericsson’s study is that he and his colleagues
couldn’t find any “naturals,” musicians who floated effortlessly to the
top while practicing a fraction of the time their peers did. Nor could they
find any “grinds,” people who worked harder than everyone else, yet just
didn’t have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggests
that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school,
the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or
she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t
work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work
much, much harder.
The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a
critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in studies of
expertise. In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the
magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours.
“The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of
practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being
a world-class expert—in anything,” writes the neurologist Daniel
Levitin. “In study after study, of composers, basketball players, fiction
writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and
what have you, this number comes up again and again. Of course, this
doesn’t address why some people get more out of their practice sessions
than others do. But no one has yet found a case in which true world-class
expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain
this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.”
This is true even of people we think of as prodigies. Mozart, for
example, famously started writing music at six. But, writes the
psychologist Michael Howe in his book Genius Explained,
by the standards of mature composers, Mozart’s early works are
not outstanding. The earliest pieces were all probably written
down by his father, and perhaps improved in the process. Many of
Wolfgang’s childhood compositions, such as the first seven of his
concertos for piano and orchestra, are largely arrangements of
works by other composers. Of those concertos that only contain
music original to Mozart, the earliest that is now regarded as a
masterwork (No. 9, K. 271) was not composed until he was

twenty-one: by that time Mozart had already been composing
concertos for ten years.
The music critic Harold Schonberg goes further: Mozart, he argues,
actually “developed late,” since he didn’t produce his greatest work until
he had been composing for more than twenty years.
To become a chess grandmaster also seems to take about ten years.
(Only the legendary Bobby Fischer got to that elite level in less than that
amount of time: it took him nine years.) And what’s ten years? Well, it’s
roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice.
Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness.
Here is the explanation for what was so puzzling about the rosters of
the Czech and Canadian national sports teams. There was practically no
one on those teams born after September 1, which doesn’t seem to make
any sense. You’d think that there should be a fair number of Czech
hockey or soccer prodigies born late in the year who are so talented that
they eventually make their way into the top tier as young adults, despite
their birth dates.
But to Ericsson and those who argue against the primacy of talent,
that isn’t surprising at all. That late-born prodigy doesn’t get chosen for
the all-star team as an eight-year-old because he’s too small. So he
doesn’t get the extra practice. And without that extra practice, he has no
chance at hitting ten thousand hours by the time the professional hockey
teams start looking for players. And without ten thousand hours under
his belt, there is no way he can ever master the skills necessary to play at
the top level. Even Mozart—the greatest musical prodigy of all time—
couldn’t hit his stride until he had his ten thousand hours in. Practice
isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes
you good.
The other interesting thing about that ten thousand hours, of course, is
that ten thousand hours is an enormous amount of time. It’s all but
impossible to reach that number all by yourself by the time you’re a
young adult. You have to have parents who encourage and support you.
You can’t be poor, because if you have to hold down a part-time job on
the side to help make ends meet, there won’t be time left in the day to
practice enough. In fact, most people can reach that number only if they
get into some kind of special program—like a hockey all-star squad—or

if they get some kind of extraordinary opportunity that gives them a
chance to put in those hours.
3.
So, back to Bill Joy. It’s 1971. He’s tall and gawky and sixteen years old.
He’s the math whiz, the kind of student that schools like MIT and
Caltech and the University of Waterloo attract by the hundreds. “When
Bill was a little kid, he wanted to know everything about everything way
before he should’ve even known he wanted to know,” his father,
William, says. “We answered him when we could. And when we
couldn’t, we would just give him a book.” When it came time to apply to
college, Joy got a perfect score on the math portion of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test. “It wasn’t particularly hard,” he says matter-of-factly.
“There was plenty of time to check it twice.”
He has talent by the truckload. But that’s not the only consideration.
It never is. The key to his development is that he stumbled across that
nondescript building on Beal Avenue.
In the early 1970s, when Joy was learning about programming,
computers were the size of rooms. A single machine (which might have
less power and memory than your microwave now has) could cost
upwards of a million dollars—and that’s in 1970s dollars. Computers
were rare. If you found one, it was hard to get access to it; if you
managed to get access, renting time on it cost a fortune.
What’s more, programming itself was extraordinarily tedious. This
was the era when computer programs were created using cardboard
punch cards. Each line of code was imprinted on the card using a
keypunch machine. A complex program might include hundreds, if not
thousands, of these cards in tall stacks. Once a program was ready, you
walked over to whatever mainframe computer you had access to and
gave the stack of cards to an operator. Since computers could handle
only one task at a time, the operator made an appointment for your
program, and depending on how many people were ahead of you in line,
you might not get your cards back for a few hours or even a day. And if
you made even a single error—even a typographical error—in your
program, you had to take the cards back, track down the error, and begin
the whole process again.

Under those circumstances, it was exceedingly difficult for anyone to
become a programming expert. Certainly becoming an expert by your
early twenties was all but impossible. When you can “program” for only
a few minutes out of every hour you spend in the computer room, how
can you ever get in ten thousand hours of practice? “Programming with
cards,” one computer scientist from that era remembers, “did not teach
you programming. It taught you patience and proofreading.”
It wasn’t until the mid-1960s that a solution to the programming
problem emerged. Computers were finally powerful enough that they
could handle more than one “appointment” at once. If the computer’s
operating system was rewritten, computer scientists realized, the
machine’s time could be shared; the computer could be trained to handle
hundreds of tasks at the same time. That, in turn, meant that
programmers didn’t have to physically hand their stacks of computer
cards to the operator anymore. Dozens of terminals could be built, all
linked to the mainframe by a telephone line, and everyone could be
working—online—all at once.
Here is how one history of the period describes the advent of time-
sharing:
This was not just a revolution. It was a revelation. Forget the
operator, the card decks, the wait. With time-sharing, you could sit
at your Teletype, bang in a couple of commands, and get an
answer then and there. Time-sharing was interactive: A program
could ask for a response, wait for you to type it in, act on it while
you waited, and show you the result, all in “real time.”
This is where Michigan came in, because Michigan was one of the
first universities in the world to switch over to time-sharing. By 1967, a
prototype of the system was up and running. By the early 1970s,
Michigan had enough computing power that a hundred people could be
programming simultaneously in the Computer Center. “In the late sixties,
early seventies, I don’t think there was anyplace else that was exactly
like Michigan,” Mike Alexander, one of the pioneers of Michigan’s
computing system, said. “Maybe MIT. Maybe Carnegie Mellon. Maybe
Dartmouth. I don’t think there were any others.”

This was the opportunity that greeted Bill Joy when he arrived on the
Ann Arbor campus in the fall of 1971. He hadn’t chosen Michigan
because of its computers. He had never done anything with computers in
high school. He was interested in math and engineering. But when the
programming bug hit him in his freshman year, he found himself—by
the happiest of accidents—in one of the few places in the world where a
seventeen-year-old could program all he wanted.
“Do you know what the difference is between the computing cards
and time-sharing?” Joy says. “It’s the difference between playing chess
by mail and speed chess.” Programming wasn’t an exercise in frustration
anymore. It was fun.
“I lived in the north campus, and the Computer Center was in the
north campus,” Joy went on. “How much time did I spend there? Oh, a
phenomenal amount of time. It was open twenty-four hours. I would stay
there all night, and just walk home in the morning. In an average week in
those years, I was spending more time in the Computer Center than on
my classes. All of us down there had this recurring nightmare of
forgetting to show up for class at all, of not even realizing we were
enrolled.
“The challenge was that they gave all the students an account with a
fixed amount of money, so your time would run out. When you signed
on, you would put in how long you wanted to spend on the computer.
They gave you, like, an hour of time. That’s all you’d get. But someone
figured out that if you put in ‘time equals’ and then a letter, like t equals
k, they wouldn’t charge you,” he said, laughing at the memory. “It was a
bug in the software. You could put in t equals k and sit there forever.”
Just look at the stream of opportunities that came Bill Joy’s way.
Because he happened to go to a farsighted school like the University of
Michigan, he was able to practice on a time-sharing system instead of
with punch cards; because the Michigan system happened to have a bug
in it, he could program all he wanted; because the university was willing
to spend the money to keep the Computer Center open twenty-four
hours, he could stay up all night; and because he was able to put in so
many hours, by the time he happened to be presented with the
opportunity to rewrite UNIX, he was up to the task. Bill Joy was
brilliant. He wanted to learn. That was a big part of it. But before he
could become an expert, someone had to give him the opportunity to
learn how to be an expert.

“At Michigan, I was probably programming eight or ten hours a day,”
he went on. “By the time I was at Berkeley I was doing it day and night.
I had a terminal at home. I’d stay up until two or three o’clock in the
morning, watching old movies and programming. Sometimes I’d fall
asleep at the keyboard”—he mimed his head falling on the keyboard
—“and you know how the key repeats until the end, and it starts to go
beep, beep, beep? After that happens three times, you have to go to bed. I
was still relatively incompetent even when I got to Berkeley. I was
proficient by my second year there. That’s when I wrote programs that
are still in use today, thirty years later.” He paused for a moment to do
the math in his head—which for someone like Bill Joy doesn’t take very
long. Michigan in 1971. Programming in earnest by sophomore year.
Add in the summers, then the days and nights in his first year at
Berkeley. “So, so maybe… ten thousand hours?” he said, finally. “That’s
about right.”
4.
Is the ten-thousand-hour rule a general rule of success? If we scratch
below the surface of every great achiever, do we always find the
equivalent of the Michigan Computer Center or the hockey all-star team
—some sort of special opportunity for practice?
Let’s test the idea with two examples, and for the sake of simplicity,
let’s make them as familiar as possible: the Beatles, one of the most
famous rock bands ever; and Bill Gates, one of the world’s richest men.
The Beatles—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and
Ringo Starr—came to the United States in February of 1964, starting the
so-called British Invasion of the American music scene and putting out a
string of hit records that transformed the face of popular music.
The first interesting thing about the Beatles for our purposes is how
long they had already been together by the time they reached the United
States. Lennon and McCartney first started playing together in 1957,
seven years prior to landing in America. (Incidentally, the time that
elapsed between their founding and their arguably greatest artistic
achievements—Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles
[White Album]—is ten years.) And if you look even more closely at
those long years of preparation, you’ll find an experience that, in the
context of hockey players and Bill Joy and world-class violinists, sounds

awfully familiar. In 1960, while they were still just a struggling high
school rock band, they were invited to play in Hamburg, Germany.
“Hamburg in those days did not have rock-and-roll music clubs. It
had strip clubs,” says Philip Norman, who wrote the Beatles biography
Shout! “There was one particular club owner called Bruno, who was
originally a fairground showman. He had the idea of bringing in rock
groups to play in various clubs. They had this formula. It was a huge
nonstop show, hour after hour, with a lot of people lurching in and the
other lot lurching out. And the bands would play all the time to catch the
passing traffic. In an American red-light district, they would call it
nonstop striptease.
“Many of the bands that played in Hamburg were from Liverpool,”
Norman went on. “It was an accident. Bruno went to London to look for
bands. But he happened to meet an entrepreneur from Liverpool in Soho
who was down in London by pure chance. And he arranged to send some
bands over. That’s how the connection was established. And eventually
the Beatles made a connection not just with Bruno but with other club
owners as well. They kept going back because they got a lot of alcohol
and a lot of sex.”
And what was so special about Hamburg? It wasn’t that it paid well.
It didn’t. Or that the acoustics were fantastic. They weren’t. Or that the
audiences were savvy and appreciative. They were anything but. It was
the sheer amount of time the band was forced to play.
Here is John Lennon, in an interview after the Beatles disbanded,
talking about the band’s performances at a Hamburg strip club called the
Indra:
We got better and got more confidence. We couldn’t help it with
all the experience playing all night long. It was handy them being
foreign. We had to try even harder, put our heart and soul into it,
to get ourselves over.
In Liverpool, we’d only ever done one-hour sessions, and we
just used to do our best numbers, the same ones, at every one. In
Hamburg, we had to play for eight hours, so we really had to find
a new way of playing.
Eight hours?

Here is Pete Best, the Beatles’ drummer at the time: “Once the news
got out about that we were making a show, the club started packing them
in. We played seven nights a week. At first we played almost nonstop till
twelve-thirty, when it closed, but as we got better the crowds stayed till
two most mornings.”
Seven days a week?
The Beatles ended up traveling to Hamburg five times between 1960
and the end of 1962. On the first trip, they played 106 nights, five or
more hours a night. On their second trip, they played 92 times. On their
third trip, they played 48 times, for a total of 172 hours on stage. The last
two Hamburg gigs, in November and December of 1962, involved
another 90 hours of performing. All told, they performed for 270 nights
in just over a year and a half. By the time they had their first burst of
success in 1964, in fact, they had performed live an estimated twelve
hundred times. Do you know how extraordinary that is? Most bands
today don’t perform twelve hundred times in their entire careers. The
Hamburg crucible is one of the things that set the Beatles apart.
“They were no good onstage when they went there and they were
very good when they came back,” Norman went on. “They learned not
only stamina. They had to learn an enormous amount of numbers—cover
versions of everything you can think of, not just rock and roll, a bit of
jazz too. They weren’t disciplined onstage at all before that. But when
they came back, they sounded like no one else. It was the making of
them.”
5.
Let’s now turn to the history of Bill Gates. His story is almost as well
known as the Beatles’. Brilliant, young math whiz discovers computer
programming. Drops out of Harvard. Starts a little computer company
called Microsoft with his friends. Through sheer brilliance and ambition
and guts builds it into the giant of the software world. That’s the broad
outline. Let’s dig a little bit deeper.
Gates’s father was a wealthy lawyer in Seattle, and his mother was
the daughter of a well-to-do banker. As a child Bill was precocious and
easily bored by his studies. So his parents took him out of public school
and, at the beginning of seventh grade, sent him to Lakeside, a private

school that catered to Seattle’s elite families. Midway through Gates’s
second year at Lakeside, the school started a computer club.
“The Mothers’ Club at school did a rummage sale every year, and
there was always the question of what the money would go to,” Gates
remembers. “Some went to the summer program, where inner-city kids
would come up to the campus. Some of it would go for teachers. That
year, they put three thousand dollars into a computer terminal down in
this funny little room that we subsequently took control of. It was kind of
an amazing thing.”
It was an “amazing thing,” of course, because this was 1968. Most
colleges didn’t have computer clubs in the 1960s. Even more remarkable
was the kind of computer Lakeside bought. The school didn’t have its
students learn programming by the laborious computer-card system, like
virtually everyone else was doing in the 1960s. Instead, Lakeside
installed what was called an ASR-33 Teletype, which was a time-sharing
terminal with a direct link to a mainframe computer in downtown
Seattle. “The whole idea of time-sharing only got invented in nineteen
sixty-five,” Gates continued. “Someone was pretty forward-looking.”
Bill Joy got an extraordinary, early opportunity to learn programming on
a time-share system as a freshman in college, in 1971. Bill Gates got to
do real-time programming as an eighth grader in 1968.
From that moment forward, Gates lived in the computer room. He
and a number of others began to teach themselves how to use this strange
new device. Buying time on the mainframe computer the ASR was
hooked up to was, of course, expensive—even for a wealthy institution
like Lakeside—and it wasn’t long before the $3,000 put up by the
Mothers’ Club ran out. The parents raised more money. The students
spent it. Then a group of programmers at the University of Washington
formed an outfit called Computer Center Corporation (or C-Cubed),
which leased computer time to local companies. As luck would have it,
one of the founders of the firm—Monique Rona—had a son at Lakeside,
a year ahead of Gates. Would the Lakeside computer club, Rona
wondered, like to test out the company’s software programs on the
weekends in exchange for free programming time? Absolutely! After
school, Gates took the bus to the C-Cubed offices and programmed long
into the evening.
C-Cubed eventually went bankrupt, so Gates and his friends began
hanging around the computer center at the University of Washington.

Before long, they latched onto an outfit called ISI (Information Sciences
Inc.), which agreed to let them have free computer time in exchange for
working on a piece of software that could be used to automate company
payrolls. In one seven-month period in 1971, Gates and his cohorts ran
up 1,575 hours of computer time on the ISI mainframe, which averages
out to eight hours a day, seven days a week.
“It was my obsession,” Gates says of his early high school years. “I
skipped athletics. I went up there at night. We were programming on
weekends. It would be a rare week that we wouldn’t get twenty or thirty
hours in. There was a period where Paul Allen and I got in trouble for
stealing a bunch of passwords and crashing the system. We got kicked
out. I didn’t get to use the computer the whole summer. This is when I
was fifteen and sixteen. Then I found out Paul had found a computer that
was free at the University of Washington. They had these machines in
the medical center and the physics department. They were on a twenty-
four-hour schedule, but with this big slack period, so that between three
and six in the morning they never scheduled anything.” Gates laughed.
“I’d leave at night, after my bedtime. I could walk up to the University of
Washington from my house. Or I’d take the bus. That’s why I’m always
so generous to the University of Washington, because they let me steal so
much computer time.” (Years later, Gates’s mother said, “We always
wondered why it was so hard for him to get up in the morning.”)
One of the founders of ISI, Bud Pembroke, then got a call from the
technology company TRW, which had just signed a contract to set up a
computer system at the huge Bonneville Power station in southern
Washington State. TRW desperately needed programmers familiar with
the particular software the power station used. In these early days of the
computer revolution, programmers with that kind of specialized
experience were hard to find. But Pembroke knew exactly whom to call:
those high school kids from Lakeside who had been running up
thousands of hours of computer time on the ISI mainframe. Gates was
now in his senior year, and somehow he managed to convince his
teachers to let him decamp for Bonneville under the guise of an
independent study project. There he spent the spring writing code,
supervised by a man named John Norton, who Gates says taught him as
much about programming as almost anyone he’d ever met.
Those five years, from eighth grade through the end of high school,
were Bill Gates’s Hamburg, and by any measure, he was presented with

an even more extraordinary series of opportunities than Bill Joy.
Opportunity number one was that Gates got sent to Lakeside. How
many high schools in the world had access to a time-sharing terminal in
1968? Opportunity number two was that the mothers of Lakeside had
enough money to pay for the school’s computer fees. Number three was
that, when that money ran out, one of the parents happened to work at C-
Cubed, which happened to need someone to check its code on the
weekends, and which also happened not to care if weekends turned into
weeknights. Number four was that Gates just happened to find out about
ISI, and ISI just happened to need someone to work on its payroll
software. Number five was that Gates happened to live within walking
distance of the University of Washington. Number six was that the
university happened to have free computer time between three and six in
the morning. Number seven was that TRW happened to call Bud
Pembroke. Number eight was that the best programmers Pembroke knew
for that particular problem happened to be two high school kids. And
number nine was that Lakeside was willing to let those kids spend their
spring term miles away, writing code.
And what did virtually all of those opportunities have in common?
They gave Bill Gates extra time to practice. By the time Gates dropped
out of Harvard after his sophomore year to try his hand at his own
software company, he’d been programming practically nonstop for seven
consecutive years. He was way past ten thousand hours. How many
teenagers in the world had the kind of experience Gates had? “If there
were fifty in the world, I’d be stunned,” he says. “There was C-Cubed
and the payroll stuff we did, then TRW—all those things came together. I
had a better exposure to software development at a young age than I
think anyone did in that period of time, and all because of an incredibly
lucky series of events.”

If we put the stories of hockey players and the Beatles and Bill Joy and
Bill Gates together, I think we get a more complete picture of the path to
success. Joy and Gates and the Beatles are all undeniably talented.
Lennon and McCartney had a musical gift of the sort that comes along
once in a generation, and Bill Joy, let us not forget, had a mind so quick

that he was able to make up a complicated algorithm on the fly that left
his professors in awe. That much is obvious.
But what truly distinguishes their histories is not their extraordinary
talent but their extraordinary opportunities. The Beatles, for the most
random of reasons, got invited to go to Hamburg. Without Hamburg, the
Beatles might well have taken a different path. “I was very lucky,” Bill
Gates said at the beginning of our interview. That doesn’t mean he isn’t
brilliant or an extraordinary entrepreneur. It just means that he
understands what incredible good fortune it was to be at Lakeside in
1968.
All the outliers we’ve looked at so far were the beneficiaries of some
kind of unusual opportunity. Lucky breaks don’t seem like the exception
with software billionaires and rock bands and star athletes. They seem
like the rule.
Let me give you one final example of the hidden opportunities that
outliers benefit from. Suppose we do another version of the calendar
analysis we did in the previous chapter with hockey players, only this
time looking at birth years, not birth months. To start with, take a close
look at the following list of the seventy-five richest people in human
history. The net worth of each person is calculated in current US dollars.
As you can see, it includes queens and kings and pharaohs from
centuries past, as well as contemporary billionaires, such as Warren
Buffett and Carlos Slim.

Do you know what’s interesting about that list? Of the seventy-five
names, an astonishing fourteen are Americans born within nine years of
one another in the mid-nineteenth century. Think about that for a
moment. Historians start with Cleopatra and the pharaohs and comb
through every year in human history ever since, looking in every corner
of the world for evidence of extraordinary wealth, and almost 20 percent
of the names they end up with come from a single generation in a single
country.
Here’s the list of those Americans and their birth years:
  1. John D. Rockefeller, 1839
  2. Andrew Carnegie, 1835
28. Frederick Weyerhaeuser, 1834
33. Jay Gould, 1836
34. Marshall Field, 1834
35. George F. Baker, 1840
36. Hetty Green, 1834
44. James G. Fair, 1831

54. Henry H. Rogers, 1840
57. J. P. Morgan, 1837
58. Oliver H. Payne, 1839
62. George Pullman, 1831
64. Peter Arrell Brown Widener, 1834
65. Philip Danforth Armour, 1832
What’s going on here? The answer becomes obvious if you think
about it. In the 1860s and 1870s, the American economy went through
perhaps the greatest transformation in its history. This was when the
railroads were being built and when Wall Street emerged. It was when
industrial manufacturing started in earnest. It was when all the rules by
which the traditional economy had functioned were broken and remade.
What this list says is that it really matters how old you were when that
transformation happened.
If you were born in the late 1840s you missed it. You were too young
to take advantage of that moment. If you were born in the 1820s you
were too old: your mind-set was shaped by the pre–Civil War paradigm.
But there was a particular, narrow nine-year window that was just perfect
for seeing the potential that the future held. All of the fourteen men and
women on the list above had vision and talent. But they also were given
an extraordinary opportunity, in the same way that hockey and soccer
players born in January, February, and March are given an extraordinary
opportunity.*
Now let’s do the same kind of analysis for people like Bill Joy and
Bill Gates.
If you talk to veterans of Silicon Valley, they’ll tell you that the most
important date in the history of the personal computer revolution was
January 1975. That was when the magazine Popular Electronics ran a
cover story on an extraordinary machine called the Altair 8800. The
Altair cost $397. It was a do-it-yourself contraption that you could
assemble at home. The headline on the story read: “PROJECT
BREAKTHROUGH! World’s First Minicomputer Kit to Rival
Commercial Models.”
To the readers of Popular Electronics, in those days the bible of the
fledgling software and computer world, that headline was a revelation.
Computers up to that point had been the massive, expensive mainframes
of the sort sitting in the white expanse of the Michigan Computer Center.

For years, every hacker and electronics whiz had dreamt of the day when
a computer would come along that was small and inexpensive enough
for an ordinary person to use and own. That day had finally arrived.
If January 1975 was the dawn of the personal computer age, then who
would be in the best position to take advantage of it? The same
principles apply here that applied to the era of John Rockefeller and
Andrew Carnegie.
“If you’re too old in nineteen seventy-five, then you’d already have a
job at IBM out of college, and once people started at IBM, they had a
real hard time making the transition to the new world,” says Nathan
Myhrvold, who was a top executive at Microsoft for many years. “You
had this multibillion-dollar company making mainframes, and if you
were part of that, you’d think, Why screw around with these little
pathetic computers? That was the computer industry to those people, and
it had nothing to do with this new revolution. They were blinded by that
being the only vision of computing. They made a nice living. It’s just
that there was no opportunity to become a zillionaire and make an impact
on the world.”
If you were more than a few years out of college in 1975, then you
belonged to the old paradigm. You had just bought a house. You’re
married. A baby is on the way. You’re in no position to give up a good
job and pension for some pie-in-the-sky $397 computer kit. So let’s rule
out all those born before, say, 1952.
At the same time, though, you don’t want to be too young. You really
want to get in on the ground floor, right in 1975, and you can’t do that if
you’re still in high school. So let’s also rule out anyone born after, say,
1958. The perfect age to be in 1975, in other words, is old enough to be a
part of the coming revolution but not so old that you missed it. Ideally,
you want to be twenty or twenty-one, which is to say, born in 1954 or
1955.
There is an easy way to test this theory. When was Bill Gates born?
Bill Gates: October 28, 1955
That’s the perfect birth date! Gates is the hockey player born on January
1. Gates’s best friend at Lakeside was Paul Allen. He also hung out in the
computer room with Gates and shared those long evenings at ISI and C-

Cubed. Allen went on to found Microsoft with Bill Gates. When was
Paul Allen born?
Paul Allen: January 21, 1953
The third-richest man at Microsoft is the one who has been running the
company on a day-to-day basis since 2000, one of the most respected
executives in the software world, Steve Ballmer. Ballmer’s birth date?
Steve Ballmer: March 24, 1956
Let’s not forget a man every bit as famous as Gates: Steve Jobs, the
cofounder of Apple Computer. Unlike Gates, Jobs wasn’t from a rich
family and he didn’t go to Michigan, like Joy. But it doesn’t take much
investigation of his upbringing to realize that he had his Hamburg too.
He grew up in Mountain View, California, just south of San Francisco,
which is the absolute epicenter of Silicon Valley. His neighborhood was
filled with engineers from Hewlett-Packard, then as now one of the most
important electronics firms in the world. As a teenager he prowled the
flea markets of Mountain View, where electronics hobbyists and
tinkerers sold spare parts. Jobs came of age breathing the air of the very
business he would later dominate.
This paragraph from Accidental Millionaire, one of the many Jobs
biographies, gives us a sense of how extraordinary his childhood
experiences were. Jobs
attended evening talks by Hewlett-Packard scientists. The talks
were about the latest advances in electronics and Jobs, exercising
a style that was a trademark of his personality, collared Hewlett-
Packard engineers and drew additional information from them.
Once he even called Bill Hewlett, one of the company’s founders,
to request parts. Jobs not only received the parts he asked for, he
managed to wrangle a summer job. Jobs worked on an assembly
line to build computers and was so fascinated that he tried to
design his own…

Wait. Bill Hewlett gave him spare parts? That’s on a par with Bill
Gates getting unlimited access to a time-share terminal at age thirteen.
It’s as if you were interested in fashion and your neighbor when you
were growing up happened to be Giorgio Armani. And when was Jobs
born?
Steve Jobs: February 24, 1955
Another of the pioneers of the software revolution was Eric Schmidt. He
ran Novell, one of Silicon Valley’s most important software firms, and in
2001, he became the chief executive officer of Google. Birth date?
Eric Schmidt: April 27, 1955
I don’t mean to suggest, of course, that every software tycoon in Silicon
Valley was born in 1955. Some weren’t, just as not every business titan
in the United States was born in the mid-1830s. But there are very
clearly patterns here, and what’s striking is how little we seem to want to
acknowledge them. We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of
individual merit. But there’s nothing in any of the histories we’ve looked
at so far to suggest things are that simple. These are stories, instead,
about people who were given a special opportunity to work really hard
and seized it, and who happened to come of age at a time when that
extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society. Their success
was not just of their own making. It was a product of the world in which
they grew up.
By the way, let’s not forget Bill Joy. Had he been just a little bit older
and had he had to face the drudgery of programming with computer
cards, he says, he would have studied science. Bill Joy the computer
legend would have been Bill Joy the biologist. And had he come along a
few years later, the little window that gave him the chance to write the
supporting code for the Internet would have closed. Again, Bill Joy the
computer legend might well have been Bill Joy the biologist. When was
Bill Joy born?
Bill Joy: November 8, 1954

Joy would go on, after his stint at Berkeley, to become one of the four
founders of Sun Microsystems, one of the oldest and most important of
Silicon Valley’s software companies. And if you still think that accidents
of time and place and birth don’t matter all that much, here are the
birthdays of the three other founders of Sun Microsystems:
Scott McNealy: November 13, 1954
Vinod Khosla: January 28, 1955
Andy Bechtolsheim: September 30, 1955

CHAPTER THREE

The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 1
“KNOWLEDGE OF A BOY’S IQ IS OF LITTLE HELP IF YOU ARE FACED WITH
A FORMFUL OF CLEVER BOYS.”
1.
In the fifth episode of the 2008 season, the American television quiz
show 1 vs. 100 had as its special guest a man named Christopher Langan.
The television show 1 vs. 100 is one of many that sprang up in the
wake of the phenomenal success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. It
features a permanent gallery of one hundred ordinary people who serve
as what is called the “mob.” Each week they match wits with a special
invited guest. At stake is a million dollars. The guest has to be smart
enough to answer more questions correctly than his or her one hundred
adversaries—and by that standard, few have ever seemed as superbly
qualified as Christopher Langan.
“Tonight the mob takes on their fiercest competition yet,” the voice-
over began. “Meet Chris Langan, who many call the smartest man in
America.” The camera did a slow pan of a stocky, muscular man in his
fifties. “The average person has an IQ of one hundred,” the voice-over
continued. “Einstein one fifty. Chris has an IQ of one ninety-five. He’s
currently wrapping his big brain around a theory of the universe. But will
his king-size cranium be enough to take down the mob for one million
dollars? Find out right now on One versus One Hundred.”
Out strode Langan onto the stage amid wild applause.
“You don’t think you need to have a high intellect to do well on One
versus One Hundred, do you?” the show’s host, Bob Saget, asked him.
Saget looked at Langan oddly, as if he were some kind of laboratory
specimen.
“Actually, I think it could be a hindrance,” Langan replied. He had a
deep, certain voice. “To have a high IQ, you tend to specialize, think
deep thoughts. You avoid trivia. But now that I see these people”—he
glanced at the mob, the amusement in his eyes betraying just how
ridiculous he found the proceedings—“I think I’ll do okay.”
Over the past decade, Chris Langan has achieved a strange kind of
fame. He has become the public face of genius in American life, a

celebrity outlier. He gets invited on news shows and profiled in
magazines, and he has been the subject of a documentary by the
filmmaker Errol Morris, all because of a brain that appears to defy
description.
The television news show 20/20 once hired a neuropsychologist to
give Langan an IQ test, and Langan’s score was literally off the charts—
too high to be accurately measured. Another time, Langan took an IQ
test specially designed for people too smart for ordinary IQ tests. He got
all the questions right except one.* He was speaking at six months of
age. When he was three, he would listen to the radio on Sundays as the
announcer read the comics aloud, and he would follow along on his own
until he had taught himself to read. At five, he began questioning his
grandfather about the existence of God—and remembers being
disappointed in the answers he got.
In school, Langan could walk into a test in a foreign-language class,
not having studied at all, and if there were two or three minutes before
the instructor arrived, he could skim through the textbook and ace the
test. In his early teenage years, while working as a farmhand, he started
to read widely in the area of theoretical physics. At sixteen, he made his
way through Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead’s famously
abstruse masterpiece Principia Mathematica. He got a perfect score on
his SAT, even though he fell asleep at one point during the test.
“He did math for an hour,” his brother Mark says of Langan’s
summer routine in high school. “Then he did French for an hour. Then he
studied Russian. Then he would read philosophy. He did that religiously,
every day.”
Another of his brothers, Jeff, says, “You know, when Christopher was
fourteen or fifteen, he would draw things just as a joke, and it would be
like a photograph. When he was fifteen, he could match Jimi Hendrix
lick for lick on a guitar. Boom. Boom. Boom. Half the time, Christopher
didn’t attend school at all. He would just show up for tests and there was
nothing they could do about it. To us, it was hilarious. He could brief a
semester’s worth of textbooks in two days, and take care of whatever he
had to take care of, and then get back to whatever he was doing in the
first place.”*
On the set of 1 vs. 100, Langan was poised and confident. His voice
was deep. His eyes were small and fiercely bright. He did not circle
about topics, searching for the right phrase, or double back to restate a

previous sentence. For that matter, he did not say um, or ah, or use any
form of conversational mitigation: his sentences came marching out, one
after another, polished and crisp, like soldiers on a parade ground. Every
question Saget threw at him, he tossed aside, as if it were a triviality.
When his winnings reached $250,000, he appeared to make a mental
calculation that the risks of losing everything were at that point greater
than the potential benefits of staying in. Abruptly, he stopped. “I’ll take
the cash,” he said. He shook Saget’s hand firmly and was finished—
exiting on top as, we like to think, geniuses invariably do.
2.
Just after the First World War, Lewis Terman, a young professor of
psychology at Stanford University, met a remarkable boy named Henry
Cowell. Cowell had been raised in poverty and chaos. Because he did not
get along with other children, he had been unschooled since the age of
seven. He worked as a janitor at a one-room schoolhouse not far from the
Stanford campus, and throughout the day, Cowell would sneak away
from his job and play the school piano. And the music he made was
beautiful.
Terman’s specialty was intelligence testing; the standard IQ test that
millions of people around the world would take during the following
fifty years, the Stanford-Binet, was his creation. So he decided to test
Cowell’s IQ. The boy must be intelligent, he reasoned, and sure enough,
he was. He had an IQ of above 140, which is near genius level. Terman
was fascinated. How many other diamonds in the rough were there? he
wondered.
He began to look for others. He found a girl who knew the alphabet at
nineteen months, and another who was reading Dickens and Shakespeare
by the time she was four. He found a young man who had been kicked
out of law school because his professors did not believe that it was
possible for a human being to precisely reproduce long passages of legal
opinions from memory.
In 1921, Terman decided to make the study of the gifted his life work.
Armed with a large grant from the Commonwealth Foundation, he put
together a team of fieldworkers and sent them out into California’s
elementary schools. Teachers were asked to nominate the brightest
students in their classes. Those children were given an intelligence test.

The students who scored in the top 10 percent were then given a second
IQ test, and those who scored above 130 on that test were given a third
IQ test, and from that set of results Terman selected the best and the
brightest. By the time Terman was finished, he had sorted through the
records of some 250,000 elementary and high school students, and
identified 1,470 children whose IQs averaged over 140 and ranged as
high as 200. That group of young geniuses came to be known as the
“Termites,” and they were the subjects of what would become one of the
most famous psychological studies in history.
For the rest of his life, Terman watched over his charges like a mother
hen. They were tracked and tested, measured and analyzed. Their
educational attainments were noted, marriages followed, illnesses
tabulated, psychological health charted, and every promotion and job
change dutifully recorded. Terman wrote his recruits letters of
recommen-dation for jobs and graduate school applications. He doled out
a constant stream of advice and counsel, all the time recording his
findings in thick red volumes entitled Genetic Studies of Genius.
“There is nothing about an individual as important as his IQ, except
possibly his morals,” Terman once said. And it was to those with a very
high IQ, he believed, that “we must look for production of leaders who
advance science, art, government, education and social welfare
generally.” As his subjects grew older, Terman issued updates on their
progress, chronicling their extraordinary achievements. “It is almost
impossible,” Terman wrote giddily, when his charges were in high
school, “to read a newspaper account of any sort of competition or
activity in which California boys and girls participate without finding
among the winners the names of one or more… members of our gifted
group.” He took writing samples from some of his most artistically
minded subjects and had literary critics compare them to the early
writings of famous authors. They could find no difference. All the signs
pointed, he said, to a group with the potential for “heroic stature.”
Terman believed that his Termites were destined to be the future elite of
the United States.
Today, many of Terman’s ideas remain central to the way we think
about success. Schools have programs for the “gifted.” Elite universities
often require that students take an intelligence test (such as the American
Scholastic Aptitude Test) for admission. High-tech companies like
Google or Microsoft carefully measure the cognitive abilities of

prospective employees out of the same belief: they are convinced that
those at the very top of the IQ scale have the greatest potential. (At
Microsoft, famously, job applicants are asked a battery of questions
designed to test their smarts, including the classic “Why are manhole
covers round?” If you don’t know the answer to that question, you’re not
smart enough to work at Microsoft.*)
If I had magical powers and offered to raise your IQ by 30 points,
you’d say yes—right? You’d assume that would help you get further
ahead in the world. And when we hear about someone like Chris Langan,
our instinctive response is the same as Terman’s instinctive response
when he met Henry Cowell almost a century ago. We feel awe. Geniuses
are the ultimate outliers. Surely there is nothing that can hold someone
like that back.
But is that true?
So far in Outliers, we’ve seen that extraordinary achievement is less
about talent than it is about opportunity. In this chapter, I want to try to
dig deeper into why that’s the case by looking at the outlier in its purest
and most distilled form—the genius. For years, we’ve taken our cues
from people like Terman when it comes to understanding the
significance of high intelligence. But, as we shall see, Terman made an
error. He was wrong about his Termites, and had he happened on the
young Chris Langan working his way through Principia Mathematica at
the age of sixteen, he would have been wrong about him for the same
reason. Terman didn’t understand what a real outlier was, and that’s a
mistake we continue to make to this day.
3.
One of the most widely used intelligence tests is something called
Raven’s Progressive Matrices. It requires no language skills or specific
body of acquired knowledge. It’s a measure of abstract reasoning skills.
A typical Raven’s test consists of forty-eight items, each one harder than
the one before it, and IQ is calculated based on how many items are
answered correctly.
Here’s a question, typical of the sort that is asked on the Raven’s.

Did you get that? I’m guessing most of you did. The correct answer is C.
But now try this one. It’s the kind of really hard question that comes at
the end of the Raven’s.
The correct answer is A. I have to confess I couldn’t figure this one out,
and I’m guessing most of you couldn’t either. Chris Langan almost
certainly could, however. When we say that people like Langan are
really brilliant, what we mean is that they have the kind of mind that can
figure out puzzles like that last question.
Over the years, an enormous amount of research has been done in an
attempt to determine how a person’s performance on an IQ test like the

Raven’s translates to real-life success. People at the bottom of the scale
—with an IQ below 70—are considered mentally disabled. A score of
100 is average; you probably need to be just above that mark to be able
to handle college. To get into and succeed in a reasonably competitive
graduate program, meanwhile, you probably need an IQ of at least 115.
In general, the higher your score, the more education you’ll get, the more
money you’re likely to make, and—believe it or not—the longer you’ll
live.
But there’s a catch. The relationship between success and IQ works
only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere
around 120, having additional IQ points doesn’t seem to translate into
any measurable real-world advantage.*
“It is amply proved that someone with an IQ of 170 is more likely to
think well than someone whose IQ is 70,” the British psychologist Liam
Hudson has written, “and this holds true where the comparison is much
closer—between IQs of, say, 100 and 130. But the relation seems to
break down when one is making comparisons between two people both
of whom have IQs which are relatively high…. A mature scientist with
an adult IQ of 130 is as likely to win a Nobel Prize as is one whose IQ is
180.”
What Hudson is saying is that IQ is a lot like height in basketball.
Does someone who is five foot six have a realistic chance of playing
professional basketball? Not really. You need to be at least six foot or six
one to play at that level, and, all things being equal, it’s probably better
to be six two than six one, and better to be six three than six two. But
past a certain point, height stops mattering so much. A player who is six
foot eight is not automatically better than someone two inches shorter.
(Michael Jordan, the greatest player ever, was six six after all.) A
basketball player only has to be tall enough—and the same is true of
intelligence. Intelligence has a threshold.
The introduction to the 1 vs. 100 episode pointed out that Einstein
had an IQ of 150 and Langan has an IQ of 195. Langan’s IQ is 30
percent higher than Einstein’s. But that doesn’t mean Langan is 30
percent smarter than Einstein. That’s ridiculous. All we can say is that
when it comes to thinking about really hard things like physics, they are
both clearly smart enough.
The idea that IQ has a threshold, I realize, goes against our intuition.
We think that, say, Nobel Prize winners in science must have the highest

IQ scores imaginable; that they must be the kinds of people who got
perfect scores on their entrance examinations to college, won every
scholarship available, and had such stellar academic records in high
school that they were scooped up by the top universities in the country.
But take a look at the following list of where the last twenty-five
Americans to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine got their undergraduate
degrees, starting in 2007.
Antioch College
Brown University
UC Berkeley
University of Washington
Columbia University
Case Institute of Technology
MIT
Caltech
Harvard University
Hamilton College
Columbia University
University of North Carolina
DePauw University
University of Pennsylvania
University of Minnesota
University of Notre Dame
Johns Hopkins University
Yale University
Union College, Kentucky
University of Illinois
University of Texas
Holy Cross
Amherst College
Gettysburg College
Hunter College
No one would say that this list represents the college choices of the
absolute best high school students in America. Yale and Columbia and

MIT are on the list, but so are DePauw, Holy Cross, and Gettysburg
College. It’s a list of good schools.
Along the same lines, here are the colleges of the last twenty-five
American Nobel laureates in Chemistry:
City College of New York
City College of New York
Stanford University
University of Dayton, Ohio
Rollins College, Florida
MIT
Grinnell College
MIT
McGill University
Georgia Institute of Technology
Ohio Wesleyan University
Rice University
Hope College
Brigham Young University
University of Toronto
University of Nebraska
Dartmouth College
Harvard University
Berea College
Augsburg College
University of Massachusetts
Washington State University
University of Florida
University of California, Riverside
Harvard University
To be a Nobel Prize winner, apparently, you have to be smart enough
to get into a college at least as good as Notre Dame or the University of
Illinois. That’s all.*
This is a radical idea, isn’t it? Suppose that your teenage daughter
found out that she had been accepted at two universities—Harvard
University and Georgetown University, in Washington, DC. Where

would you want her to go? I’m guessing Harvard, because Harvard is a
“better” school. Its students score a good 10 to 15 percent higher on their
entrance exams.
But given what we are learning about intelligence, the idea that
schools can be ranked, like runners in a race, makes no sense.
Georgetown’s students may not be as smart on an absolute scale as the
students of Harvard. But they are all, clearly, smart enough, and future
Nobel Prize winners come from schools like Georgetown as well as from
schools like Harvard.
The psychologist Barry Schwartz recently proposed that elite schools
give up their complex admissions process and simply hold a lottery for
everyone above the threshold. “Put people into two categories,”
Schwartz says. “Good enough and not good enough. The ones who are
good enough get put into a hat. And those who are not good enough get
rejected.” Schwartz concedes that his idea has virtually no chance of
being accepted. But he’s absolutely right. As Hudson writes (and keep in
mind that he did his research at elite all-male English boarding schools in
the 1950s and 1960s), “Knowledge of a boy’s IQ is of little help if you
are faced with a formful of clever boys.”*
Let me give you an example of the threshold effect in action. The
University of Michigan law school, like many elite US educational
institutions, uses a policy of affirmative action when it comes to
applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. Around 10 percent of the
students Michigan enrolls each fall are members of racial minorities, and
if the law school did not significantly relax its entry requirements for
those students—admitting them with lower undergraduate grades and
lower standardized-test scores than everyone else—it estimates that
percentage would be less than 3 percent. Furthermore, if we compare the
grades that the minority and nonminority students get in law school, we
see that the white students do better. That’s not surprising: if one group
has higher undergraduate grades and test scores than the other, it’s almost
certainly going to have higher grades in law school as well. This is one
reason that affirmative action programs are so controversial. In fact, an
attack on the University of Michigan’s affirmative action program
recently went all the way to the US Supreme Court. For many people it
is troubling that an elite educational institution lets in students who are
less qualified than their peers.

A few years ago, however, the University of Michigan decided to
look closely at how the law school’s minority students had fared after
they graduated. How much money did they make? How far up in the
profession did they go? How satisfied were they with their careers? What
kind of social and community contributions did they make? What kind of
honors had they won? They looked at everything that could conceivably
be an indication of real-world success. And what they found surprised
them.
“We knew that our minority students, a lot of them, were doing well,”
says Richard Lempert, one of the authors of the Michigan study. “I think
our expectation was that we would find a half- or two-thirds-full glass,
that they had not done as well as the white students but nonetheless a lot
were quite successful. But we were completely surprised. We found that
they were doing every bit as well. There was no place we saw any
serious discrepancy.”
What Lempert is saying is that by the only measure that a law school
really ought to care about—how well its graduates do in the real world—
minority students aren’t less qualified. They’re just as successful as
white students. And why? Because even though the academic credentials
of minority students at Michigan aren’t as good as those of white
students, the quality of students at the law school is high enough that
they’re still above the threshold. They are smart enough. Knowledge of a
law student’s test scores is of little help if you are faced with a classroom
of clever law students.
4.
Let’s take the threshold idea one step further. If intelligence matters only
up to a point, then past that point, other things—things that have nothing
to do with intelligence—must start to matter more. It’s like basketball
again: once someone is tall enough, then we start to care about speed and
court sense and agility and ball-handling skills and shooting touch.
So, what might some of those other things be? Well, suppose that
instead of measuring your IQ, I gave you a totally different kind of test.
Write down as many different uses that you can think of for the
following objects:
1. a brick

2. a blanket
This is an example of what’s called a “divergence test” (as opposed to
a test like the Raven’s, which asks you to sort through a list of
possibilities and converge on the right answer). It requires you to use
your imagination and take your mind in as many different directions as
possible. With a divergence test, obviously there isn’t a single right
answer. What the test giver is looking for are the number and the
uniqueness of your responses. And what the test is measuring isn’t
analytical intelligence but something profoundly different—something
much closer to creativity. Divergence tests are every bit as challenging as
convergence tests, and if you don’t believe that, I encourage you to pause
and try the brick-and-blanket test right now.
Here, for example, are answers to the “uses of objects” test collected
by Liam Hudson from a student named Poole at a top British high
school:
(Brick). To use in smash-and-grab raids. To help hold a house
together. To use in a game of Russian roulette if you want to keep
fit at the same time (bricks at ten paces, turn and throw—no
evasive action allowed). To hold the eiderdown on a bed tie a
brick at each corner. As a breaker of empty Coca-Cola bottles.
(Blanket). To use on a bed. As a cover for illicit sex in the woods.
As a tent. To make smoke signals with. As a sail for a boat, cart or
sled. As a substitute for a towel. As a target for shooting practice
for short-sighted people. As a thing to catch people jumping out of
burning skyscrapers.
It’s not hard to read Poole’s answers and get some sense of how his
mind works. He’s funny. He’s a little subversive and libidinous. He has
the flair for the dramatic. His mind leaps from violent imagery to sex to
people jumping out of burning skyscrapers to very practical issues, such
as how to get a duvet to stay on a bed. He gives us the impression that if
we gave him another ten minutes, he’d come up with another twenty
uses.*

Now, for the sake of comparison, consider the answers of another
student from Hudson’s sample. His name is Florence. Hudson tells us
that Florence is a prodigy, with one of the highest IQs in his school.
(Brick). Building things, throwing.
(Blanket). Keeping warm, smothering fire, tying to trees and
sleeping in (as a hammock), improvised stretcher.
Where is Florence’s imagination? He identified the most common
and most functional uses for bricks and blankets and simply stopped.
Florence’s IQ is higher than Poole’s. But that means little, since both
students are above the threshold. What is more interesting is that Poole’s
mind can leap from violent imagery to sex to people jumping out of
buildings without missing a beat, and Florence’s mind can’t. Now which
of these two students do you think is better suited to do the kind of
brilliant, imaginative work that wins Nobel Prizes?
That’s the second reason Nobel Prize winners come from Holy Cross
as well as Harvard, because Harvard isn’t selecting its students on the
basis of how well they do on the “uses of a brick” test—and maybe “uses
of a brick” is a better predictor of Nobel Prize ability. It’s also the second
reason Michigan Law School couldn’t find a difference between its
affirmative action graduates and the rest of its alumni. Being a successful
lawyer is about a lot more than IQ. It involves having the kind of fertile
mind that Poole had. And just because Michigan’s minority students
have lower scores on convergence tests doesn’t mean they don’t have
that other critical trait in abundance.
5.
This was Terman’s error. He fell in love with the fact that his Termites
were at the absolute pinnacle of the intellectual scale—at the ninety-
ninth percentile of the ninety-ninth percentile—without realizing how
little that seemingly extraordinary fact meant.
By the time the Termites reached adulthood, Terman’s error was plain
to see. Some of his child geniuses had grown up to publish books and
scholarly articles and thrive in business. Several ran for public office,

and there were two superior court justices, one municipal court judge,
two members of the California state legislature, and one prominent state
official. But few of his geniuses were nationally known figures. They
tended to earn good incomes—but not that good. The majority had
careers that could only be considered ordinary, and a surprising number
ended up with careers that even Terman considered failures. Nor were
there any Nobel Prize winners in his exhaustively selected group of
geniuses. His fieldworkers actually tested two elementary students who
went on to be Nobel laureates—William Shockley and Luis Alvarez—
and rejected them both. Their IQs weren’t high enough.
In a devastating critique, the sociologist Pitirim Sorokin once showed
that if Terman had simply put together a randomly selected group of
children from the same kinds of family backgrounds as the Termites—
and dispensed with IQs altogether—he would have ended up with a
group doing almost as many impressive things as his painstakingly
selected group of geniuses. “By no stretch of the imagination or of
standards of genius,” Sorokin concluded, “is the ‘gifted group’ as a
whole ‘gifted.’ ” By the time Terman came out with his fourth volume of
Genetic Studies of Genius, the word “genius” had all but vanished. “We
have seen,” Terman concluded, with more than a touch of
disappointment, “that intellect and achievement are far from perfectly
correlated.”
What I told you at the beginning of this chapter about the
extraordinary intelligence of Chris Langan, in other words, is of little use
if we want to understand his chances of being a success in the world.
Yes, he is a man with a one-in-a-million mind and the ability to get
through Principia Mathematica at sixteen. And yes, his sentences come
marching out one after another, polished and crisp like soldiers on a
parade ground. But so what? If we want to understand the likelihood of
his becoming a true outlier, we have to know a lot more about him than
that.

CHAPTER FOUR

The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2
“AFTER PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS, IT WAS AGREED THAT ROBERT
WOULD BE PUT ON PROBATION.”
1.
Chris Langan’s mother was from San Francisco and was estranged from
her family. She had four sons, each with a different father. Chris was the
eldest. His father disappeared before Chris was born; he was said to have
died in Mexico. His mother’s second husband was murdered. Her third
committed suicide. Her fourth was a failed journalist named Jack
Langan.
“To this day I haven’t met anybody who was as poor when they were
kids as our family was,” Chris Langan says. “We didn’t have a pair of
matched socks. Our shoes had holes in them. Our pants had holes in
them. We only had one set of clothes. I remember my brothers and I
going into the bathroom and using the bathtub to wash our only set of
clothes and we were bare-assed naked when we were doing that because
we didn’t have anything to wear.”
Jack Langan would go on drinking sprees and disappear. He would
lock the kitchen cabinets so the boys couldn’t get to the food. He used a
bullwhip to keep the boys in line. He would get jobs and then lose them,
moving the family on to the next town. One summer the family lived on
an Indian reservation in a teepee, subsisting on government-surplus
peanut butter and cornmeal. For a time, they lived in Virginia City,
Nevada. “There was only one law officer in town, and when the Hell’s
Angels came to town, he would crouch down in the back of his office,”
Mark Langan remembers. “There was a bar there, I’ll always remember.
It was called the Bucket of Blood Saloon.”
When the boys were in grade school, the family moved to Bozeman,
Montana. One of Chris’s brothers spent time in a foster home. Another
was sent to reform school.
“I don’t think the school ever understood just how gifted Christopher
was,” his brother Jeff says. “He sure as hell didn’t play it up. This was
Bozeman. It wasn’t like it is today. It was a small hick town when we
were growing up. We weren’t treated well there. They’d just decided that

my family was a bunch of deadbeats.” To stick up for himself and his
brothers, Chris started to lift weights. One day, when Chris was fourteen,
Jack Langan got rough with the boys, as he sometimes did, and Chris
knocked him out cold. Jack left, never to return. Upon graduation from
high school, Chris was offered two full scholarships, one to Reed
College in Oregon and the other to the University of Chicago. He chose
Reed.
“It was a huge mistake,” Chris recalls. “I had a real case of culture
shock. I was a crew-cut kid who had been working as a ranch hand in the
summers in Montana, and there I was, with a whole bunch of long-haired
city kids, most of them from New York. And these kids had a whole
different style than I was used to. I couldn’t get a word in edgewise at
class. They were very inquisitive. Asking questions all the time. I was
crammed into a dorm room. There were four of us, and the other three
guys had a whole different other lifestyle. They were smoking pot. They
would bring their girlfriends into the room. I had never smoked pot
before. So basically I took to hiding in the library.”
He continued: “Then I lost that scholarship…. My mother was
supposed to fill out a parents’ financial statement for the renewal of that
scholarship. She neglected to do so. She was confused by the
requirements or whatever. At some point, it came to my attention that my
scholarship had not been renewed. So I went to the office to ask why,
and they told me, Well, no one sent us the financial statement, and we
allocated all the scholarship money and it’s all gone, so I’m afraid that
you don’t have a scholarship here anymore. That was the style of the
place. They simply didn’t care. They didn’t give a shit about their
students. There was no counseling, no mentoring, nothing.”
Chris left Reed before the final set of exams, leaving him with a row
of Fs on his transcript. In the first semester, he had earned As. He went
back to Bozeman and worked in construction and as a forest services
firefighter for a year and a half. Then he enrolled at Montana State
University.
“I was taking math and philosophy classes,” he recalled. “And then in
the winter quarter, I was living thirteen miles out of town, out on Beach
Hill Road, and the transmission fell out of my car. My brothers had used
it when I was gone that summer. They were working for the railroad and
had driven it on the railroad tracks. I didn’t have the money to repair it.
So I went to my adviser and the dean in sequence and said, I have a

problem. The transmission fell out of my car, and you have me in a
seven-thirty a.m. and eight-thirty a.m. class. If you could please just
transfer me to the afternoon sections of these classes, I would appreciate
it because of this car problem. There was a neighbor who was a rancher
who was going to take me in at eleven o’clock. My adviser was this
cowboy-looking guy with a handlebar mustache, dressed in a tweed
jacket. He said, ‘Well, son, after looking at your transcript at Reed
College, I see that you have yet to learn that everyone has to make
sacrifices to get an education. Request denied.’ So then I went to the
dean. Same treatment.”
His voice grew tight. He was describing things that had happened
more than thirty years ago, but the memory still made him angry. “At
that point I realized, here I was, knocking myself out to make the money
to make my way back to school, and it’s the middle of the Montana
winter. I am willing to hitchhike into town every day, do whatever I had
to do, just to get into school and back, and they are unwilling to do
anything for me. So bananas. And that was the point I decided I could do
without the higher-education system. Even if I couldn’t do without it, it
was sufficiently repugnant to me that I wouldn’t do it anymore. So I
dropped out of college, simple as that.”
Chris Langan’s experiences at Reed and Montana State represented a
turning point in his life. As a child, he had dreamt of becoming an
academic. He should have gotten a PhD; universities are institutions
structured, in large part, for people with his kind of deep intellectual
interests and curiosity. “Once he got into the university environment, I
thought he would prosper, I really did,” his brother Mark says. “I thought
he would somehow find a niche. It made absolutely no sense to me when
he left that.”
Without a degree, Langan floundered. He worked in construction.
One frigid winter he worked on a clam boat on Long Island. He took
factory jobs and minor civil service positions and eventually became a
bouncer in a bar on Long Island, which was his principal occupation for
much of his adult years. Through it all, he continued to read deeply in
philosophy, mathematics, and physics as he worked on a sprawling
treatise he calls the “CTMU”—the “Cognitive Theoretic Model of the
Universe.” But without academic credentials, he despairs of ever getting
published in a scholarly journal.

“I am a guy who has a year and a half of college,” he says, with a
shrug. “And at some point this will come to the attention of the editor, as
he is going to take the paper and send it off to the referees, and these
referees are going to try and look me up, and they are not going to find
me. And they are going to say, This guy has a year and a half of college.
How can he know what he’s talking about?”
It is a heartbreaking story. At one point I asked Langan—
hypothetically—whether he would take a job at Harvard University were
it offered to him. “Well, that’s a difficult question,” he replied.
“Obviously, as a full professor at Harvard I would count. My ideas
would have weight and I could use my position, my affiliation at
Harvard, to promote my ideas. An institution like that is a great source of
intellectual energy, and if I were at a place like that, I could absorb the
vibration in the air.” It was suddenly clear how lonely his life has been.
Here he was, a man with an insatiable appetite for learning, forced for
most of his adult life to live in intellectual isolation. “I even noticed that
kind of intellectual energy in the year and a half I was in college,” he
said, almost wistfully. “Ideas are in the air constantly. It’s such a
stimulating place to be.
“On the other hand,” he went on, “Harvard is basically a glorified
corporation, operating with a profit incentive. That’s what makes it tick.
It has an endowment in the billions of dollars. The people running it are
not necessarily searching for truth and knowledge. They want to be big
shots, and when you accept a paycheck from these people, it is going to
come down to what you want to do and what you feel is right versus
what the man says you can do to receive another paycheck. When you’re
there, they got a thumb right on you. They are out to make sure you
don’t step out of line.”
2.
What does the story of Chris Langan tell us? His explanations, as
heartbreaking as they are, are also a little strange. His mother forgets to
sign his financial aid form and—just like that—no scholarship. He tries
to move from a morning to an afternoon class, something students do
every day, and gets stopped cold. And why were Langan’s teachers at
Reed and Montana State so indifferent to his plight? Teachers typically
delight in minds as brilliant as his. Langan talks about dealing with Reed

and Montana State as if they were some kind of vast and unyielding
government bureaucracy. But colleges, particularly small liberal arts
colleges like Reed, tend not to be rigid bureaucracies. Making
allowances in the name of helping someone stay in school is what
professors do all the time.
Even in his discussion of Harvard, it’s as if Langan has no conception
of the culture and particulars of the institution he’s talking about. When
you accept a paycheck from these people, it is going to come down to
what you want to do and what you feel is right versus what the man says
you can do to receive another paycheck. What? One of the main reasons
college professors accept a lower paycheck than they could get in private
industry is that university life gives them the freedom to do what they
want to do and what they feel is right. Langan has Harvard backwards.
When Langan told me his life story, I couldn’t help thinking of the
life of Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who famously headed the
American effort to develop the nuclear bomb during World War II.
Oppenheimer, by all accounts, was a child with a mind very much like
Chris Langan’s. His parents considered him a genius. One of his teachers
recalled that “he received every new idea as perfectly beautiful.” He was
doing lab experiments by the third grade and studying physics and
chemistry by the fifth grade. When he was nine, he once told one of his
cousins, “Ask me a question in Latin and I will answer you in Greek.”
Oppenheimer went to Harvard and then on to Cambridge University
to pursue a doctorate in physics. There, Oppenheimer, who struggled
with depression his entire life, grew despondent. His gift was for
theoretical physics, and his tutor, a man named Patrick Blackett (who
would win a Nobel Prize in 1948), was forcing him to attend to the
minutiae of experimental physics, which he hated. He grew more and
more emotionally unstable, and then, in an act so strange that to this day
no one has properly made sense of it, Oppenheimer took some chemicals
from the laboratory and tried to poison his tutor.
Blackett, luckily, found out that something was amiss. The university
was informed. Oppenheimer was called on the carpet. And what
happened next is every bit as unbelievable as the crime itself. Here is
how the incident is described in American Prometheus, Kai Bird and
Martin Sherwin’s biography of Oppenheimer: “After protracted
negotiations, it was agreed that Robert would be put on probation and

have regular sessions with a prominent Harley Street psychiatrist in
London.”
On probation?
Here we have two very brilliant young students, each of whom runs
into a problem that imperils his college career. Langan’s mother has
missed a deadline for his financial aid. Oppenheimer has tried to poison
his tutor. To continue on, they are required to plead their cases to
authority. And what happens? Langan gets his scholarship taken away,
and Oppenheimer gets sent to a psychiatrist. Oppenheimer and Langan
might both be geniuses, but in other ways, they could not be more
different.
The story of Oppenheimer’s appointment to be scientific director of
the Manhattan Project twenty years later is perhaps an even better
example of this difference. The general in charge of the Manhattan
Project was Leslie Groves, and he scoured the country, trying to find the
right person to lead the atomic-bomb effort. Oppenheimer, by rights, was
a long shot. He was just thirty-eight, and junior to many of the people
whom he would have to manage. He was a theorist, and this was a job
that called for experimenters and engineers. His political affiliations
were dodgy: he had all kinds of friends who were Communists. Perhaps
more striking, he had never had any administrative experience. “He was
a very impractical fellow,” one of Oppenheimer’s friends later said. “He
walked about with scuffed shoes and a funny hat, and, more important,
he didn’t know anything about equipment.” As one Berkeley scientist
put it, more succinctly: “He couldn’t run a hamburger stand.”
Oh, and by the way, in graduate school he tried to kill his tutor. This
was the résumé of the man who was trying out for what might be said to
be—without exaggeration—one of the most important jobs of the
twentieth century. And what happened? The same thing that happened
twenty years earlier at Cambridge: he got the rest of the world to see
things his way.
Here are Bird and Sherwin again: “Oppenheimer understood that
Groves guarded the entrance to the Manhattan Project, and he therefore
turned on all his charm and brilliance. It was an irresistible
performance.” Groves was smitten. “ ‘He’s a genius,’ Groves later told a
reporter. ‘A real genius.’ ” Groves was an engineer by training with a
graduate degree from MIT, and Oppenheimer’s great insight was to
appeal to that side of Groves. Bird and Sherwin go on: “Oppenheimer

was the first scientist Groves had met on his tour [of potential
candidates] who grasped that building an atomic bomb required finding
practical solutions to a variety of cross-disciplinary problems….
[Groves] found himself nodding in agreement when Oppenheimer
pitched the notion of a central laboratory devoted to this purpose, where,
as he later testified, ‘we could begin to come to grips with chemical,
metallurgical, engineering and ordnance problems that had so far
received no consideration.’ ”
Would Oppenheimer have lost his scholarship at Reed? Would he
have been unable to convince his professors to move his classes to the
afternoon? Of course not. And that’s not because he was smarter than
Chris Langan. It’s because he possessed the kind of savvy that allowed
him to get what he wanted from the world.
“They required that everyone take introductory calculus,” Langan
said of his brief stay at Montana State. “And I happened to get a guy who
taught it in a very dry, very trivial way. I didn’t understand why he was
teaching it this way. So I asked him questions. I actually had to chase
him down to his office. I asked him, ‘Why are you teaching this way?
Why do you consider this practice to be relevant to calculus?’ And this
guy, this tall, lanky guy, always had sweat stains under his arms, he
turned and looked at me and said, ‘You know, there is something you
should probably get straight. Some people just don’t have the intellectual
firepower to be mathematicians.’ ”
There they are, the professor and the prodigy, and what the prodigy
clearly wants is to be engaged, at long last, with a mind that loves
mathematics as much as he does. But he fails. In fact—and this is the
most heartbreaking part of all—he manages to have an entire
conversation with his calculus professor without ever communicating the
one fact most likely to appeal to a calculus professor. The professor
never realizes that Chris Langan is good at calculus.
3.
The particular skill that allows you to talk your way out of a murder rap,
or convince your professor to move you from the morning to the
afternoon section, is what the psychologist Robert Sternberg calls
“practical intelligence.” To Sternberg, practical intelligence includes
things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and

knowing how to say it for maximum effect.” It is procedural: it is about
knowing how to do something without necessarily knowing why you
know it or being able to explain it. It’s practical in nature: that is, it’s not
knowledge for its own sake. It’s knowledge that helps you read situations
correctly and get what you want. And, critically, it is a kind of
intelligence separate from the sort of analytical ability measured by IQ.
To use the technical term, general intelligence and practical intelligence
are “orthogonal”: the presence of one doesn’t imply the presence of the
other. You can have lots of analytical intelligence and very little practical
intelligence, or lots of practical intelligence and not much analytical
intelligence, or—as in the lucky case of someone like Robert
Oppenheimer—you can have lots of both.
So where does something like practical intelligence come from? We
know where analytical intelligence comes from. It’s something, at least
in part, that’s in your genes. Chris Langan started talking at six months.
He taught himself to read at three years of age. He was born smart. IQ is
a measure, to some degree, of innate ability.* But social savvy is
knowledge. It’s a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from
somewhere, and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitudes
and skills is from our families.
Perhaps the best explanation we have of this process comes from the
sociologist Annette Lareau, who a few years ago conducted a fascinating
study of a group of third graders. She picked both blacks and whites and
children from both wealthy homes and poor homes, zeroing in,
ultimately, on twelve families. Lareau and her team visited each family
at least twenty times, for hours at a stretch. She and her assistants told
their subjects to treat them like “the family dog,” and they followed them
to church and to soccer games and to doctor’s appointments, with a tape
recorder in one hand and a notebook in the other.
You might expect that if you spent such an extended period in twelve
different households, what you would gather is twelve different ideas
about how to raise children: there would be the strict parents and the lax
parents and the hyperinvolved parents and the mellow parents and on
and on. What Lareau found, however, is something much different.
There were only two parenting “philosophies,” and they divided almost
perfectly along class lines. The wealthier parents raised their kids one
way, and the poorer parents raised their kids another way.

The wealthier parents were heavily involved in their children’s free
time, shuttling them from one activity to the next, quizzing them about
their teachers and coaches and teammates. One of the well-off children
Lareau followed played on a baseball team, two soccer teams, a swim
team, and a basketball team in the summer, as well as playing in an
orchestra and taking piano lessons.
That kind of intensive scheduling was almost entirely absent from the
lives of the poor children. Play for them wasn’t soccer practice twice a
week. It was making up games outside with their siblings and other kids
in the neighborhood. What a child did was considered by his or her
parents as something separate from the adult world and not particularly
consequential. One girl from a working-class family—Katie Brindle—
sang in a choir after school. But she signed up for it herself and walked
to choir practice on her own. Lareau writes:
What Mrs. Brindle doesn’t do that is routine for middle-class
mothers is view her daughter’s interest in singing as a signal to
look for other ways to help her develop that interest into a formal
talent. Similarly Mrs. Brindle does not discuss Katie’s interest in
drama or express regret that she cannot afford to cultivate her
daughter’s talent. Instead she frames Katie’s skills and interests as
character traits—singing and acting are part of what makes Katie
“Katie.” She sees the shows her daughter puts on as “cute” and as
a way for Katie to “get attention.”
The middle-class parents talked things through with their children,
reasoning with them. They didn’t just issue commands. They expected
their children to talk back to them, to negotiate, to question adults in
positions of authority. If their children were doing poorly at school, the
wealthier parents challenged their teachers. They intervened on behalf of
their kids. One child Lareau follows just misses qualifying for a gifted
program. Her mother arranges for her to be retested privately, petitions
the school, and gets her daughter admitted. The poor parents, by contrast,
are intimidated by authority. They react passively and stay in the
background. Lareau writes of one low-income parent:

At a parent-teacher conference, for example, Ms. McAllister (who
is a high school graduate) seems subdued. The gregarious and
outgoing nature she displays at home is hidden in this setting. She
sits hunched over in the chair and she keeps her jacket zipped up.
She is very quiet. When the teacher reports that Harold has not
been turning in his homework, Ms. McAllister clearly is
flabbergasted, but all she says is, “He did it at home.” She does
not follow up with the teacher or attempt to intervene on Harold’s
behalf. In her view, it is up to the teachers to manage her son’s
education. That is their job, not hers.
Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.”
It’s an attempt to actively “foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions
and skills.” Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of
“accomplishment of natural growth.” They see as their responsibility to
care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own.
Lareau stresses that one style isn’t morally better than the other. The
poorer children were, to her mind, often better behaved, less whiny, more
creative in making use of their own time, and had a well-developed sense
of independence. But in practical terms, concerted cultivation has
enormous advantages. The heavily scheduled middle-class child is
exposed to a constantly shifting set of experiences. She learns teamwork
and how to cope in highly structured settings. She is taught how to
interact comfortably with adults, and to speak up when she needs to. In
Lareau’s words, the middle-class children learn a sense of “entitlement.”
That word, of course, has negative connotations these days. But
Lareau means it in the best sense of the term: “They acted as though they
had a right to pursue their own individual preferences and to actively
manage interactions in institutional settings. They appeared comfortable
in those settings; they were open to sharing information and asking for
attention…. It was common practice among middle-class children to
shift interactions to suit their preferences.” They knew the rules. “Even
in fourth grade, middle-class children appeared to be acting on their own
behalf to gain advantages. They made special requests of teachers and
doctors to adjust procedures to accommodate their desires.”
By contrast, the working-class and poor children were characterized
by “an emerging sense of distance, distrust, and constraint.” They didn’t
know how to get their way, or how to “customize”—using Lareau’s

wonderful term—whatever environment they were in, for their best
purposes.
In one telling scene, Lareau describes a visit to the doctor by Alex
Williams, a nine-year-old boy, and his mother, Christina. The Williamses
are wealthy professionals.
“Alex, you should be thinking of questions you might want to ask the
doctor,” Christina says in the car on the way to the doctor’s office. “You
can ask him anything you want. Don’t be shy. You can ask anything.”
Alex thinks for a minute, then says, “I have some bumps under my
arms from my deodorant.” Christina: “Really? You mean from your new
deodorant?” Alex: “Yes.” Christina: “Well, you should ask the doctor.”
Alex’s mother, Lareau writes, “is teaching that he has the right to
speak up”—that even though he’s going to be in a room with an older
person and authority figure, it’s perfectly all right for him to assert
himself. They meet the doctor, a genial man in his early forties. He tells
Alex that he is in the ninety-fifth percentile in height. Alex then
interrupts:
ALEX: I’m in the what?
DOCTOR: It means that you’re taller than more than ninety-five out of
a hundred young men when they’re, uh, ten years old.
ALEX: I’m not ten.
DOCTOR: Well, they graphed you at ten. You’re—nine years and ten
months. They—they usually take the closest year to that graph.
Look at how easily Alex interrupts the doctor—“I’m not ten.” That’s
entitlement: his mother permits that casual incivility because she wants
him to learn to assert himself with people in positions of authority.
THE DOCTOR TURNS TO ALEX: Well, now the most important question.
Do you have any questions you want to ask me before I do your
physical?
ALEX: Um… only one. I’ve been getting some bumps on my arms,
right around here (indicates underarm).
DOCTOR: Underneath?
ALEX: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll have to take a look at those when I come in closer
to do the checkup. And I’ll see what they are and what I can do.

Do they hurt or itch?
ALEX: No, they’re just there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll take a look at those bumps for you.
This kind of interaction simply doesn’t happen with lower-class
children, Lareau says. They would be quiet and submissive, with eyes
turned away. Alex takes charge of the moment. “In remembering to raise
the question he prepared in advance, he gains the doctor’s full attention
and focuses it on an issue of his choosing,” Lareau writes.
In so doing, he successfully shifts the balance of power away from
the adults and toward himself. The transition goes smoothly. Alex
is used to being treated with respect. He is seen as special and as a
person worthy of adult attention and interest. These are key
characteristics of the strategy of concerted cultivation. Alex is not
showing off during his checkup. He is behaving much as he does
with his parents—he reasons, negotiates, and jokes with equal
ease.
It is important to understand where the particular mastery of that
moment comes from. It’s not genetic. Alex Williams didn’t inherit the
skills to interact with authority figures from his parents and grandparents
the way he inherited the color of his eyes. Nor is it racial: it’s not a
practice specific to either black or white people. As it turns out, Alex
Williams is black and Katie Brindle is white. It’s a cultural advantage.
Alex has those skills because over the course of his young life, his
mother and father—in the manner of educated families—have
painstakingly taught them to him, nudging and prodding and
encouraging and showing him the rules of the game, right down to that
little rehearsal in the car on the way to the doctor’s office.
When we talk about the advantages of class, Lareau argues, this is in
large part what we mean. Alex Williams is better off than Katie Brindle
because he’s wealthier and because he goes to a better school, but also
because—and perhaps this is even more critical—the sense of
entitlement that he has been taught is an attitude perfectly suited to
succeeding in the modern world.

4.
This is the advantage that Oppenheimer had and that Chris Langan
lacked. Oppenheimer was raised in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods
in Manhattan, the son of an artist and a successful garment manufacturer.
His childhood was the embodiment of concerted cultivation. On
weekends, the Oppenheimers would go driving in the countryside in a
chauffeur-driven Packard. Summers he would be taken to Europe to see
his grandfather. He attended the Ethical Culture School on Central Park
West, perhaps the most progressive school in the nation, where, his
biographers write, students were “infused with the notion that they were
being groomed to reform the world.” When his math teacher realized he
was bored, she sent him off to do independent work.
As a child, Oppenheimer was passionate about rock collecting. At the
age of twelve, he began corresponding with local geologists about rock
formations he had seen in Central Park, and he so impressed them that
they invited him to give a lecture before the New York Mineralogical
Club. As Sherwin and Bird write, Oppenheimer’s parents responded to
their son’s hobby in an almost textbook example of concerted
cultivation:
Dreading the thought of having to talk to an audience of adults,
Robert begged his father to explain that they had invited a twelve-
year-old. Greatly amused, Julius encouraged his son to accept this
honor. On the designated evening, Robert showed up at the club
with his parents, who proudly introduced their son as J. Robert
Oppenheimer. The startled audience of geologists and amateur
rock collectors burst out laughing when he stepped up to the
podium: a wooden box had to be found for him to stand on so that
the audience could see more than the shock of his wiry black hair
sticking up above the lectern. Shy and awkward, Robert
nevertheless read his prepared remarks and was given a hearty
round of applause.
Is it any wonder Oppenheimer handled the challenges of his life so
brilliantly? If you are someone whose father has made his way up in the
business world, then you’ve seen, firsthand, what it means to negotiate
your way out of a tight spot. If you’re someone who was sent to the

Ethical Culture School, then you aren’t going to be intimidated by a row
of Cambridge dons arrayed in judgment against you. If you studied
physics at Harvard, then you know how to talk to an army general who
did engineering just down the road at MIT.
Chris Langan, by contrast, had only the bleakness of Bozeman, and a
home dominated by an angry, drunken stepfather. “[Jack] Langan did this
to all of us,” said Mark. “We all have a true resentment of authority.”
That was the lesson Langan learned from his childhood: distrust
authority and be independent. He never had a parent teach him on the
way to the doctor how to speak up for himself, or how to reason and
negotiate with those in positions of authority. He didn’t learn entitlement.
He learned constraint. It may seem like a small thing, but it was a
crippling handicap in navigating the world beyond Bozeman.
“I couldn’t get any financial aid either,” Mark went on. “We just had
zero knowledge, less than zero knowledge, of the process. How to apply.
The forms. Checkbooks. It was not our environment.”
“If Christopher had been born into a wealthy family, if he was the son
of a doctor who was well connected in some major market, I guarantee
you he would have been one of those guys you read about, knocking
back PhDs at seventeen,” his brother Jeff says. “It’s the culture you find
yourself in that determines that. The issue with Chris is that he was
always too bored to actually sit there and listen to his teachers. If
someone had recognized his intelligence and if he was from a family
where there was some kind of value on education, they would have made
sure he wasn’t bored.”
5.
When the Termites were into their adulthood, Terman looked at the
records of 730 of the men and divided them into three groups. One
hundred and fifty—the top 20 percent—fell into what Terman called the
A group. They were the true success stories, the stars—the lawyers and
physicians and engineers and academics. Ninety percent of the As
graduated from college and among them had earned 98 graduate degrees.
The middle 60 percent were the B group, those who were doing
“satisfactorily.” The bottom 150 were the Cs, the ones who Terman
judged to have done the least with their superior mental ability. They

were the postal workers and the struggling bookkeepers and the men
lying on their couches at home without any job at all.
One third of the Cs were college dropouts. A quarter only had a high
school diploma, and all 150 of the Cs—each one of whom, at one point
in his life, had been dubbed a genius—had together earned a grand total
of eight graduate degrees.
What was the difference between the As and the Cs? Terman ran
through every conceivable explanation. He looked at their physical and
mental health, their “masculinity-femininity scores,” and their hobbies
and vocational interests. He compared the ages when they started
walking and talking and what their precise IQ scores were in elementary
and high school. In the end, only one thing mattered: family background.
The As overwhelmingly came from the middle and the upper class.
Their homes were filled with books. Half the fathers of the A group had
a college degree or beyond, and this at a time when a university
education was a rarity. The Cs, on the other hand, were from the other
side of the tracks. Almost a third of them had a parent who had dropped
out of school before the eighth grade.
At one point, Terman had his fieldworkers go and visit everyone from
the A and C groups and rate their personalities and manner. What they
found is everything you would expect to find if you were comparing
children raised in an atmosphere of concerted cultivation with children
raised in an atmosphere of natural growth. The As were judged to be
much more alert, poised, attractive, and well dressed. In fact, the scores
on those four dimensions are so different as to make you think you are
looking at two different species of humans. You aren’t, of course. You’re
simply seeing the difference between those schooled by their families to
present their best face to the world, and those denied that experience.
The Terman results are deeply distressing. Let’s not forget how highly
gifted the C group was. If you had met them at five or six years of age,
you would have been overwhelmed by their curiosity and mental agility
and sparkle. They were true outliers. The plain truth of the Terman study,
however, is that in the end almost none of the genius children from the
lowest social and economic class ended up making a name for
themselves.
What did the Cs lack, though? Not something expensive or
impossible to find; not something encoded in DNA or hardwired into the
circuits of their brains. They lacked something that could have been

given to them if we’d only known they needed it: a community around
them that prepared them properly for the world. The Cs were squandered
talent. But they didn’t need to be.
6.
Today, Chris Langan lives in rural Missouri on a horse farm. He moved
there a few years ago, after he got married. He is in his fifties but looks
many years younger. He has the build of a linebacker, thick through the
chest, with enormous biceps. His hair is combed straight back from his
forehead. He has a neat, graying moustache and aviator-style glasses. If
you look into his eyes, you can see the intelligence burning behind them.
“A typical day is, I get up and make coffee. I go in and sit in front of
the computer and begin working on whatever I was working on the night
before,” he told me not long ago. “I found if I go to bed with a question
on my mind, all I have to do is concentrate on the question before I go to
sleep and I virtually always have the answer in the morning. Sometimes I
realize what the answer is because I dreamt the answer and I can
remember it. Other times I just feel the answer, and I start typing and the
answer emerges onto the page.”
He had just been reading the work of the linguist Noam Chomsky.
There were piles of books in his study. He ordered books from the library
all the time. “I always feel that the closer you get to the original sources,
the better off you are,” he said.
Langan seemed content. He had farm animals to take care of, and
books to read, and a wife he loved. It was a much better life than being a
bouncer.
“I don’t think there is anyone smarter than me out there,” he went on.
“I have never met anybody like me or never seen even an indication that
there is somebody who actually has better powers of comprehension.
Never seen it and I don’t think I am going to. I could—my mind is open
to the possibility. If anyone should challenge me—‘Oh, I think that I am
smarter than you are’—I think I could have them.”
What he said sounded boastful, but it wasn’t really. It was the
opposite—a touch defensive. He’d been working for decades now on a
project of enormous sophistication—but almost none of what he had
done had ever been published much less read by the physicists and
philosophers and mathematicians who might be able to judge its value.

Here he was, a man with a one-in-a-million mind, and he had yet to have
any impact on the world. He wasn’t holding forth at academic
conferences. He wasn’t leading a graduate seminar at some prestigious
university. He was living on a slightly tumbledown horse farm in
northern Missouri, sitting on the back porch in jeans and a cutoff T-shirt.
He knew how it looked: it was the great paradox of Chris Langan’s
genius.
“I have not pursued mainstream publishers as hard as I should have,”
he conceded. “Going around, querying publishers, trying to find an
agent. I haven’t done it, and I am not interested in doing it.”
It was an admission of defeat. Every experience he had had outside of
his own mind had ended in frustration. He knew he needed to do a better
job of navigating the world, but he didn’t know how. He couldn’t even
talk to his calculus teacher, for goodness’ sake. These were things that
others, with lesser minds, could master easily. But that’s because those
others had had help along the way, and Chris Langan never had. It wasn’t
an excuse. It was a fact. He’d had to make his way alone, and no one—
not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not
even geniuses—ever makes it alone.

CHAPTER FIVE
The Three Lessons of Joe Flom
“MARY GOT A QUARTER.”
1.
Joe Flom is the last living “named” partner of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate,Meagher and Flom. He has a corner office high atop the Condé Nast tower inManhattan. He is short and slightly hunched. His head is large, framed by longprominent ears, and his narrow blue eyes are hidden by oversize aviator-style glasses.He is slender now, but during his heyday, Flom was extremely overweight. He waddleswhen he walks. He doodles when he thinks. He mumbles when he talks, and when hemakes his way down the halls of Skadden, Arps, conversations drop to a hush.Flom grew up in the Depression in Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood. Hisparents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Isadore, was a unionorganizer in the garment industry who later went to work sewing shoulder pads forladies’ dresses. His mother worked at what was called piecework—doing appliqué athome. They were desperately poor. His family moved nearly every year when he wasgrowing up because the custom in those days was for landlords to give new tenants amonth’s free rent, and without that, his family could not get by.In junior high school, Flom took the entrance exam for the elite Townsend Harrispublic high school on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, a school that in just forty yearsof existence produced three Nobel Prize winners, six Pulitzer Prize winners, and oneSupreme Court Justice, not to mention George Gershwin and Jonas Salk, the inventorof the polio vaccine. He got in. His mother would give him a dime in the morning forbreakfast—three donuts, orange juice, and coffee at Nedick’s. After school, he pusheda hand truck in the garment district. He did two years of night school at City College inupper Manhattan—working during the days to make ends meet—signed up for thearmy, served his time, and applied to Harvard Law School.“I wanted to get into the law since I was six years old,” Flom says. He didn’t have adegree from college. Harvard took him anyway. “Why? I wrote them a letter on why Iwas the answer to sliced bread,” is how Flom explains it, with characteristic brevity. AtHarvard, in the late 1940s, he never took notes. “All of us were going through this firstyear idiocy of writing notes carefully in the classroom and doing an outline of that,then a condensation of that, and then doing it again on onionskin paper, on top of otherpaper,” remembers Charles Haar, who was a classmate of Flom’s. “It was a routinizedway of trying to learn the cases. Not Joe. He wouldn’t have any of that. But he had that

quality which we always vaguely subsumed under ‘thinking like a lawyer.’ He had thegreat capacity for judgment.”Flom was named to the Law Review—an honor reserved for the very top students inthe class. During “hiring season,” the Christmas break of his second year, he wentdown to New York to interview with the big corporate law firms of the day. “I wasungainly, awkward, a fat kid. I didn’t feel comfortable,” Flom remembers. “I was oneof two kids in my class at the end of hiring season who didn’t have a job. Then oneday, one of my professors said that there are these guys starting a firm. I had a visitwith them, and the entire time I met with them, they were telling me what the riskswere of going with a firm that didn’t have a client. The more they talked, the more Iliked them. So I said, What the hell, I’ll take a chance. They had to scrape together thethirty-six hundred a year, which was the starting salary.” In the beginning, it was justMarshall Skadden, Leslie Arps—both of whom had just been turned down for partnerat a major Wall Street law firm—and John Slate, who had worked for Pan Am airlines.Flom was their associate. They had a tiny suite of offices on the top floor of theLehman Brothers Building on Wall Street. “What kind of law did we do?” Flom says,laughing. “Whatever came in the door!”In 1954, Flom took over as Skadden’s managing partner, and the firm began togrow by leaps and bounds. Soon it had one hundred lawyers. Then two hundred. Whenit hit three hundred, one of Flom’s partners—Morris Kramer—came to him and saidthat he felt guilty about bringing in young law school graduates. Skadden was so big,Kramer said, that it was hard to imagine the firm growing beyond that and being ableto promote any of those hires. Flom told him, “Ahhh, we’ll go to one thousand.” Flomnever lacked for ambition.Today Skadden, Arps has nearly two thousand attorneys in twenty-three officesaround the world and earns well over $1 billion a year, making it one of the largest andmost powerful law firms in the world. In his office, Flom has pictures of himself withGeorge Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton. He lives in a sprawling apartment in a luxuriousbuilding on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. For a period of almost thirty years, if youwere a Fortune 500 company about to be taken over or trying to take over someoneelse, or merely a big shot in some kind of fix, Joseph Flom has been your attorney andSkadden, Arps has been your law firm—and if they weren’t, you probably wished theywere.

I hope by now that you are skeptical of this kind of story. Brilliant immigrant kidovercomes poverty and the Depression, can’t get a job at the stuffy downtown lawfirms, makes it on his own through sheer hustle and ability. It’s a rags-to-riches story,and everything we’ve learned so far from hockey players and software billionaires andthe Termites suggests that success doesn’t happen that way. Successful people don’t doit alone. Where they come from matters. They’re products of particular places andenvironments.Just as we did, then, with Bill Joy and Chris Langan, let’s start over with JosephFlom, this time putting to use everything we’ve learned from the first four chapters ofthis book. No more talk of Joe Flom’s intelligence, or personality, or ambition, though

he obviously has these three things in abundance. No glowing quotations from hisclients, testifying to his genius. No more colorful tales from the meteoric rise ofSkadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom.Instead, I’m going to tell a series of stories from the New York immigrant worldthat Joe Flom grew up in—of a fellow law student, a father and son named Mauriceand Mort Janklow, and an extraordinary couple by the name of Louis and ReginaBorgenicht—in the hopes of answering a critical question. What were Joe Flom’sopportunities? Since we know that outliers always have help along the way, can we sortthrough the ecology of Joe Flom and identify the conditions that helped create him?We tell rags-to-riches stories because we find something captivating in the idea of alone hero battling overwhelming odds. But the true story of Joe Flom’s life turns out tobe much more intriguing than the mythological version because all the things in his lifethat seem to have been disadvantages—that he was a poor child of garment workers;that he was Jewish at a time when Jews were heavily discriminated against; that hegrew up in the Depression—turn out, unexpectedly, to have been advantages. Joe Flomis an outlier. But he’s not an outlier for the reasons you might think, and the story of hisrise provides a blueprint for understanding success in his profession. By the end of thechapter, in fact, we’ll see that it is possible to take the lessons of Joe Flom, apply themto the legal world of New York City, and predict the family background, age, andorigin of the city’s most powerful attorneys, without knowing a single additional factabout them. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.
Lesson Number One: The Importance of Being Jewish
3.
One of Joe Flom’s classmates at Harvard Law School was a man named AlexanderBickel. Like Flom, Bickel was the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants wholived in the Bronx. Like Flom, Bickel had gone to public school in New York and thento City College. Like Flom, Bickel was a star in his law school class. In fact, before hiscareer was cut short by cancer, Bickel would become perhaps the finest constitutionalscholar of his generation. And like Flom and the rest of their law school classmates,Bickel went to Manhattan during “hiring season” over Christmas of 1947 to findhimself a job.His first stop was at Mudge Rose, down on Wall Street, as traditional and stuffy asany firm of that era. Mudge Rose was founded in 1869. It was where Richard Nixonpracticed in the years before he won the presidency in 1968. “We’re like the lady whoonly wants her name in the newspaper twice—when she’s born and when she dies,”one of the senior partners famously said. Bickel was taken around the firm andinterviewed by one partner after another, until he was led into the library to meet withthe firm’s senior partner. You can imagine the scene: a dark-paneled room, an artfullyfrayed Persian carpet, row upon row of leather-bound legal volumes, oil paintings ofMr. Mudge and Mr. Rose on the wall.“After they put me through the whole interview and everything,” Bickel said manyyears later, “I was brought to [the senior partner], who took it upon himself to tell methat for a boy of my antecedents”—and you can imagine how Bickel must have paused

before repeating that euphemism for his immigrant background—“I certainly had comefar. But I ought to understand how limited the possibilities of a firm like his were tohire a boy of my antecedents. And while he congratulated me on my progress, I shouldunderstand he certainly couldn’t offer me a job. But they all enjoyed seeing me and allthat.”It is clear from the transcript of Bickel’s reminiscences that his interviewer does notquite know what to do with that information. Bickel was by the time of the interview atthe height of his reputation. He had argued a case before the Supreme Court. He hadwritten brilliant books. Mudge Rose saying no to Bickel because of his “antecedents”was like the Chicago Bulls turning down Michael Jordan because they wereuncomfortable with black kids from North Carolina. It didn’t make any sense.“But for stars?” the interviewer asked, meaning, Wouldn’t they have made anexception for you?Bickel: “Stars, schmars…”In the 1940s and 1950s, the old-line law firms of New York operated like a privateclub. They were all headquartered in downtown Manhattan, in and around Wall Street,in somber, granite-faced buildings. The partners at the top firms graduated from thesame Ivy League schools, attended the same churches, and summered in the sameoceanside towns on Long Island. They wore conservative gray suits. Their partnershipswere known as “white-shoe” firms—in apparent reference to the white bucks favoredat the country club or a cocktail party, and they were very particular in whom theyhired. As Erwin Smigel wrote in The Wall Street Lawyer, his study of the New Yorklegal establishment of that era, they were looking for:
lawyers who are Nordic, have pleasing personalities and “clean-cut”appearances, are graduates of the “right schools,” have the “right” socialbackground and experience in the affairs of the world, and are endowed withtremendous stamina. A former law school dean, in discussing the qualitiesstudents need to obtain a job, offers a somewhat more realistic picture: “To get ajob [students] should be long enough on family connections, long enough onability or long enough on personality, or a combination of these. Somethingcalled acceptability is made up of the sum of its parts. If a man has any of thesethings, he could get a job. If he has two of them, he can have a choice of jobs; ifhe has three, he could go anywhere.”
Bickel’s hair was not fair. His eyes were not blue. He spoke with an accent, and hisfamily connections consisted, principally, of being the son of Solomon and YettaBickel of Bucharest, Romania, by way, most recently, of Brooklyn. Flom’s credentialswere no better. He says he felt “uncomfortable” when he went for his interviewsdowntown, and of course he did: he was short and ungainly and Jewish and talked withthe flat, nasal tones of his native Brooklyn, and you can imagine how he would havebeen perceived by some silver-haired patrician in the library. If you were not of theright background and religion and social class and you came out of law school in thatera, you joined some smaller, second-rate, upstart law firm on a rung below the bignames downtown, or you simply went into business for yourself and took “whatever

came in the door”—that is, whatever legal work the big downtown firms did not wantfor themselves. That seems horribly unfair, and it was. But as is so often the case withoutliers, buried in that setback was a golden opportunity.

The old-line Wall Street law firms had a very specific idea about what it was that theydid. They were corporate lawyers. They represented the country’s largest and mostprestigious companies, and “represented” meant they handled the taxes and the legalwork behind the issuing of stocks and bonds and made sure their clients did not runafoul of federal regulators. They did not do litigation; that is, very few of them had adivision dedicated to defending and filing lawsuits. As Paul Cravath, one of thefounders of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, the very whitest of the white-shoe firms, onceput it, the lawyer’s job was to settle disputes in the conference room, not in thecourtroom. “Among my classmates at Harvard, the thing that bright young guys didwas securities work or tax,” another white-shoe partner remembers. “Those were thedistinguished fields. Litigation was for hams, not for serious people. Corporations justdidn’t sue each other in those days.”What the old-line firms also did not do was involve themselves in hostile corporatetakeovers. It’s hard to imagine today, when corporate raiders and private-equity firmsare constantly swallowing up one company after another, but until the 1970s, it wasconsidered scandalous for one company to buy another company without the targetagreeing to be bought. Places like Mudge Rose and the other establishment firms onWall Street would not touch those kinds of deals.“The problem with hostile takeovers is that they were hostile,” says Steven Brill,who founded the trade magazine American Lawyer. “It wasn’t gentlemanly. If yourbest buddy from Princeton is the CEO of Company X, and he’s been coasting for along time, and some corporate raider shows up and says this company sucks, it makesyou uncomfortable. You think, If he goes, then maybe I go too. It’s this whole notion of
not upsetting the basic calm and stable order of things.”*
The work that “came in the door” to the generation of Jewish lawyers from theBronx and Brooklyn in the 1950s and 1960s, then, was the work the white-shoe firmsdisdained: litigation and, more important, “proxy fights,” which were the legalmaneuvers at the center of any hostile-takeover bid. An investor would take an interestin a company; he would denounce the management as incompetent and send letters toshareholders, trying to get them to give him their “proxy” so he could vote out thefirm’s executives. And to run the proxy fight, the only lawyer the investor could getwas someone like Joe Flom.In Skadden, the legal historian Lincoln Caplan describes that early world oftakeovers:
The winner of a proxy contest was determined in the snake pit. (Officially, it wascalled the counting room.) Lawyers for each side met with inspectors ofelections, whose job it was to approve or eliminate questionable proxies. Theevent was often informal, contentious and unruly. Adversaries were sometimes

in T-shirts, eating watermelon or sharing a bottle of scotch. In rare cases, theresults of the snake pit could swing the outcome of a contest and turn on a singleballot.Lawyers occasionally tried to fix an election by engineering the appointmentof inspectors who were beholden to them; inspectors commonly smoked cigarsprovided by each side. Management’s lawyer would contest the proxies of theinsurgents (“I challenge this!”) and vice versa…. Lawyers who prevailed in thesnake pit excelled at winging it. There were lawyers who knew more about therules of proxy contests, but no one was better in a fight than Joe Flom…Flom was fat (a hundred pounds overweight then, one lawyer said… ),physically unattractive (to a partner, he resembled a frog), and indifferent tosocial niceties (he would fart in public or jab a cigar close to the face ofsomeone he was talking to, without apology). But in the judgment of colleaguesand of some adversaries, his will to win was unsurpassed and he was oftenmasterful.
The white-shoe law firms would call in Flom as well whenever some corporateraider made a run at one of their establishment clients. They wouldn’t touch the case.But they were happy to outsource it to Skadden, Arps. “Flom’s early specialty wasproxy fights, and that was not what we did, just like we don’t do matrimonial work,”said Robert Rifkind, a longtime partner at Cravath, Swaine and Moore. “And thereforewe purported not to know about it. I remember once we had an issue involving a proxyfight, and one of my senior corporate partners said, Well, let’s get Joe in. And he cameto a conference room, and we all sat around and described the problem and he told uswhat to do and he left. And I said, ‘We can do that too, you know.’ And the partnersaid, ‘No, no, no, you can’t. We’re not going to do that.’ It was just that we didn’t doit.”Then came the 1970s. The old aversion to lawsuits fell by the wayside. It becameeasier to borrow money. Federal regulations were relaxed. Markets becameinternationalized. Investors became more aggressive, and the result was a boom in thenumber and size of corporate takeovers. “In nineteen eighty, if you went to theBusiness Roundtable [the association of major American corporate executives] andtook surveys about whether hostile takeovers should be allowed, two-thirds would havesaid no,” Flom said. “Now, the vote would be almost unanimously yes.” Companiesneeded to be defended against lawsuits from rivals. Hostile suitors needed to be beatenback. Investors who wanted to devour unwilling targets needed help with their legalstrategy, and shareholders needed formal representation. The dollar figures involvedwere enormous. From the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s, the amount of moneyinvolved in mergers and acquisitions every year on Wall Street increased 2,000 percent,peaking at almost a quarter of a trillion dollars.All of a sudden the things that the old-line law firms didn’t want to do—hostiletakeovers and litigation—were the things that every law firm wanted to do. And whowas the expert in these two suddenly critical areas of law? The once marginal, second-tier law firms started by the people who couldn’t get jobs at the downtown firms tenand fifteen years earlier.

“[The white-shoe firms] thought hostile takeovers were beneath contempt untilrelatively late in the game, and until they decided that, hey, maybe we ought to be inthat business, they left me alone,” Flom said. “And once you get the reputation fordoing that kind of work, the business comes to you first.”Think of how similar this is to the stories of Bill Joy and Bill Gates. Both of themtoiled away in a relatively obscure field without any great hopes for worldly success.But then—boom!—the personal computer revolution happened, and they had their tenthousand hours in. They were ready. Flom had the same experience. For twenty yearshe perfected his craft at Skadden, Arps. Then the world changed and he was ready. Hedidn’t triumph over adversity. Instead, what started out as adversity ended up being anopportunity.“It’s not that those guys were smarter lawyers than anyone else,” Rifkind says. “It’sthat they had a skill that they had been working on for years that was suddenly very
valuable.”*
Lesson Number Two: Demographic Luck
5.
Maurice Janklow enrolled in Brooklyn Law School in 1919. He was the eldest son ofJewish immigrants from Romania. He had seven brothers and sisters. One ended uprunning a small department store in Brooklyn. Two others were in the haberdasherybusiness, one had a graphic design studio, another made feather hats, and anotherworked in the finance department at Tishman Realty.Maurice, however, was the family intellectual, the only one to go to college. He gothis law degree and set up a practice on Court Street in downtown Brooklyn. He was anelegant man who dressed in a homburg and Brooks Brothers suits. In the summer, hewore a straw boater. He married the very beautiful Lillian Levantin, who was thedaughter of a prominent Talmudist. He drove a big car. He moved to Queens. He and apartner then took over a writing-paper business that gave every indication of making afortune.Here was a man who looked, for all the world, like the kind of person who shouldthrive as a lawyer in New York City. He was intelligent and educated. He came from afamily well schooled in the rules of the system. He was living in the most economicallyvibrant city in the world. But here is the strange thing: it never happened. MauriceJanklow’s career did not take off the way that he’d hoped. In his mind, he never reallymade it beyond Court Street in Brooklyn. He struggled and floundered.Maurice Janklow had a son named Mort, however, who became a lawyer as well,and the son’s story is very different from that of the father. Mort Janklow built a lawfirm from scratch in the 1960s, then put together one of the very earliest cabletelevision franchises and sold it for a fortune to Cox Broadcasting. He started a literary
agency in the 1970s, and it is today one of the most prestigious in the world.* He hashis own plane. Every dream that eluded the father was fulfilled by the son.Why did Mort Janklow succeed where Maurice Janklow did not? There are, ofcourse, a hundred potential answers to that question. But let’s take a page from the

analysis of the business tycoons born in the 1830s and the software programmers bornin 1955 and look at the differences between the two Janklows in terms of theirgeneration. Is there a perfect time for a New York Jewish lawyer to be born? It turnsout there is, and this same fact that helps explain Mort Janklow’s success is the secondkey to Joe Flom’s success as well.

Lewis Terman’s genius study, as you will recall from the chapter about Chris Langan,was an investigation into how some children with really high IQs who were bornbetween 1903 and 1917 turned out as adults. And the study found that there was agroup of real successes and there was a group of real failures, and that the successeswere far more likely to have come from wealthier families. In that sense, the Termanstudy underscores the argument Annette Lareau makes, that what your parents do for aliving, and the assumptions that accompany the class your parents belong to, matter.There’s another way to break down the Terman results, though, and that’s by whenthe Termites were born. If you divide the Termites into two groups, with those bornbetween 1903 and 1911 on one side, and those between 1912 and 1917 on the other, itturns out that the Terman failures are far more likely to have been born in the earliergroup.The explanation has to do with two of the great cataclysmic events of the twentiethcentury: the Great Depression and World War II. If you were born after 1912—say, in1915—you got out of college after the worst of the Depression was over, and you weredrafted at a young enough age that going away to war for three or four years was asmuch an opportunity as it was a disruption (provided you weren’t killed, of course).The Termites born before 1911, though, graduated from college at the height of theDepression, when job opportunities were scarce, and they were already in their latethirties when the Second World War hit, meaning that when they were drafted, they hadto disrupt careers and families and adult lives that were already well under way. Tohave been born before 1911 is to have been demographically unlucky. The mostdevastating events of the twentieth century hit you at exactly the wrong time.This same demographic logic applies to Jewish lawyers in New York like MauriceJanklow. The doors were closed to them at the big downtown law firms. So they wereoverwhelmingly solo practitioners, handling wills and divorces and contracts andminor disputes, and in the Depression the work of the solo practitioner all butdisappeared. “Nearly half of the members of the metropolitan bar earned less than theminimum subsistence level for American families,” Jerold Auerbach writes of theDepression years in New York. “One year later 1,500 lawyers were prepared to take thepauper’s oath to qualify for work relief. Jewish lawyers (approximately one-half of themetropolitan bar) discovered that their practice had become a ‘dignified road tostarvation.’ ” Regardless of the number of years they had spent in practice, theirincome was “strikingly less” than that of their Christian colleagues. Maurice Janklowwas born in 1902. When the Depression started, he was newly married and had justbought his big car, moved to Queens, and made his great gamble on the writing-paperbusiness. His timing could not have been worse.

“He was going to make a fortune,” Mort Janklow says of his father. “But theDepression killed him economically. He didn’t have any reserves, and he had no familyto fall back on. And from then on, he became very much a scrivener-type lawyer. Hedidn’t have the courage to take risks after that. It was too much for him. My father usedto close titles for twenty-five dollars. He had a friend who worked at the JamaicaSavings Bank who would throw him some business. He would kill himself for twenty-five bucks, doing the whole closing, title reports. For twenty-five bucks!“I can remember my father and mother in the morning,” Janklow continued. “Hewould say to her, ‘I got a dollar seventy-five. I need ten cents for the bus, ten cents forthe subway, a quarter for a sandwich,’ and he would give her the rest. They were thatclose to the edge.”
7.
Now contrast that experience with the experience of someone who, like Mort Janklow,was born in the 1930s.Take a look at the following chart, which shows the birthrates in the United Statesfrom 1910 to 1950. In 1915, there are almost three million babies. In 1935, that numberdrops by almost six hundred thousand, and then, within a decade and a half, thenumber is back over three million again. To put it in more precise terms, for everythousand Americans, there were 29.5 babies born in 1915; 18.7 babies born in 1935;and 24.1 babies born in 1950. The decade of the 1930s is what is called a“demographic trough.” In response to the economic hardship of the Depression,families simply stopped having children, and as a result, the generation born duringthat decade was markedly smaller than both the generation that preceded it and thegeneration that immediately followed it.

1915 2,965,000 29.5

1950 3,632,000 24.1
Here is what the economist H. Scott Gordon once wrote about the particularbenefits of being one of those people born in a small generation:
When he opens his eyes for the first time, it is in a spacious hospital, well-appointed to serve the wave that preceded him. The staff is generous with theirtime, since they have little to do while they ride out the brief period of calm untilthe next wave hits. When he comes to school age, the magnificent buildings arealready there to receive him; the ample staff of teachers welcomes him withopen arms. In high school, the basketball team is not as good as it was but there

is no problem getting time on the gymnasium floor. The university is a delightfulplace; lots of room in the classes and residences, no crowding in the cafeteria,and the professors are solicitous. Then he hits the job market. The supply of newentrants is low, and the demand is high, because there is a large wave comingbehind him providing a strong demand for the goods and services of hispotential employers.
In New York City, the early 1930s cohort was so small that class sizes were at leasthalf of what they had been twenty-five years earlier. The schools were new, built forthe big generation that had come before, and the teachers had what in the Depressionwas considered a high-status job.“The New York City public schools of the 1940s were considered the best schoolsin the country,” says Diane Ravitch, a professor at New York University who haswritten widely on the city’s educational history. “There was this generation ofeducators in the thirties and forties who would have been in another time and placecollege professors. They were brilliant, but they couldn’t get the jobs they wanted, andpublic teaching was what they did because it was security and it had a pension and youdidn’t get laid off.”The same dynamic benefited the members of that generation when they went off tocollege. Here is Ted Friedman, one of the top litigators in New York in the 1970s and1980s. Like Flom, he grew up poor, the child of struggling Jewish immigrants.“My options were City College and the University of Michigan,” Friedman said.City College was free, and Michigan—then, as now, one of the top universities in theUnited States—was $450 a year. “And the thing was, after the first year, you could geta scholarship if your grades were high,” Friedman said. “So it was only the first year Ihad to pay that, if I did well.” Friedman’s first inclination was to stay in New York.“Well, I went to City College for one day, I didn’t like it. I thought, This is going to befour more years of Bronx Science [the high school he had attended], and came home,packed my bags, and hitchhiked to Ann Arbor.” He went on:
I had a couple of hundred dollars in my pocket from the summer. I was workingthe Catskills to make enough money to pay the four-hundred-fifty-dollar tuition,and I had some left over. Then there was this fancy restaurant in Ann Arborwhere I got a job waiting tables. I also worked the night shift at River Rouge, thebig Ford plant. That was real money. It wasn’t so hard to get that job. Thefactories were looking for people. I had another job too, which paid me the bestpay I ever had before I became a lawyer, which was working in construction.During the summer, in Ann Arbor, we built the Chrysler proving grounds. Iworked there a few summers during law school. Those jobs were really highpaying, probably because you worked so much overtime.
Think about this story for a moment. The first lesson is that Friedman was willingto work hard, take responsibility for himself, and put himself through school. But thesecond, perhaps more important lesson is that he happened to come along at a time in

America when if you were willing to work hard, you could take responsibility foryourself and put yourself through school. Friedman was, at the time, what we wouldtoday call “economically disadvantaged.” He was an inner-city kid from the Bronx,neither of whose parents went to college. But look at how easy it was for him to get agood education. He graduated from his public high school in New York at a time whenNew York City public schools were the envy of the world. His first option, CityCollege, was free, and his second option, the University of Michigan, cost just $450—and the admissions process was casual enough, apparently, that he could try one schoolone day and the other the next.And how did he get there? He hitchhiked, with the money that he made in thesummer in his pocket, and when he arrived, he immediately got a series of really goodjobs to help pay his way, because the factories were “looking for people.” And ofcourse they were: they had to feed the needs of the big generation just ahead of thoseborn in the demographic trough of the 1930s, and the big generation of baby boomerscoming up behind them. The sense of possibility so necessary for success comes notjust from inside us or from our parents. It comes from our time: from the particularopportunities that our particular place in history presents us with. For a young would-be lawyer, being born in the early 1930s was a magic time, just as being born in 1955was for a software programmer, or being born in 1835 was for an entrepreneur.Today, Mort Janklow has an office high above Park Avenue filled with gorgeousworks of modern art—a Dubuffet, an Anselm Kiefer. He tells hilarious stories. (“Mymother had two sisters. One lived to be ninety-nine and the other died at ninety. Theninety-nine-year-old was a smart woman. She married my Uncle Al, who was the chiefof sales for Maidenform. Once I said to him, ‘What’s the rest of the country like, UncleAl?’ And he said, ‘Kiddo. When you leave New York, every place is Bridgeport.’ ”) Hegives the sense that the world is his for the taking. “I’ve always been a big risk taker,”he says. “When I built the cable company, in the early stages, I was making dealswhere I would have been bankrupt if I hadn’t pulled it off. I had confidence that I couldmake it work.”Mort Janklow went to New York City public schools when they were at their best.Maurice Janklow went to New York City public schools when they were at their mostovercrowded. Mort Janklow went to Columbia University Law School, becausedemographic trough babies have their pick of selective schools. Maurice Janklow wentto Brooklyn Law School, which was as good as an immigrant child could do in 1919.Mort Janklow sold his cable business for tens of millions of dollars. Maurice Janklowclosed titles for twenty-five dollars. The story of the Janklows tells us that the meteoricrise of Joe Flom could not have happened at just any time. Even the most gifted oflawyers, equipped with the best of family lessons, cannot escape the limitations of theirgeneration.“My mother was coherent until the last five or six months of her life,” MortJanklow said. “And in her delirium she talked about things that she’d never talkedabout before. She shed tears over her friends dying in the 1918 flu epidemic. Thatgeneration—my parents’ generation—lived through a lot. They lived through thatepidemic, which took, what? ten percent of the world’s population. Panic in the streets.Friends dying. And then the First World War, then the Depression, then the Second

World War. They didn’t have much of a chance. That was a very tough period. Myfather would have been much more successful in a different kind of world.”
Lesson Number Three: The Garment Industry and Meaningful Work
8.
In 1889, Louis and Regina Borgenicht boarded an ocean liner in Hamburg bound forAmerica. Louis was from Galacia, in what was then Poland. Regina was from a smalltown in Hungary. They had been married only a few years and had one small child anda second on the way. For the thirteen-day journey, they slept on straw mattresses on adeck above the engine room, hanging tight to their bunk beds as the ship pitched androlled. They knew one person in New York: Borgenicht’s sister, Sallie, who hadimmigrated ten years before. They had enough money to last a few weeks, at best. Likeso many other immigrants to America in those years, theirs was a leap of faith.Louis and Regina found a tiny apartment on Eldridge Street, on Manhattan’s LowerEast Side, for $8 a month. Louis then took to the streets, looking for work. He sawpeddlers and fruit sellers and sidewalks crammed with pushcarts. The noise andactivity and energy dwarfed what he had known in the Old World. He was firstoverwhelmed, then invigorated. He went to his sister’s fish store on Ludlow Street andpersuaded her to give him a consignment of herring on credit. He set up shop on thesidewalk with two barrels of fish, hopping back and forth between them and chantingin German:
For fryingFor bakingFor cookingGood also for eatingHerring will do for every meal,And for every class!
By the end of the week, he had cleared $8. By the second week, $13. Those wereconsiderable sums. But Louis and Regina could not see how selling herring on thestreet would lead to a constructive business. Louis then decided to try being a pushcartpeddler. He sold towels and tablecloths, without much luck. He switched to notebooks,then bananas, then socks and stockings. Was there really a future in pushcarts? Reginagave birth to a second child, a daughter, and Louis’s urgency grew. He now had fourmouths to feed.The answer came to him after five long days of walking up and down the streets ofthe Lower East Side, just as he was about to give up hope. He was sitting on anoverturned box, eating a late lunch of the sandwiches Regina had made for him. It wasclothes. Everywhere around him stores were opening—suits, dresses, overalls, shirts,skirts, blouses, trousers, all made and ready to be worn. Coming from a world whereclothing was sewn at home by hand or made to order by tailors, this was a revelation.

“To me the greatest wonder in this was not the mere quantity of garments—although that was a miracle in itself—” Borgenicht would write years later, after hebecame a prosperous manufacturer of women’s and children’s clothing, “but the factthat in America even poor people could save all the dreary, time-consuming labor ofmaking their own clothes simply by going into a store and walking out with what theyneeded. There was a field to go into, a field to thrill to.”Borgenicht took out a small notebook. Everywhere he went, he wrote down whatpeople were wearing and what was for sale—menswear, women’s wear, children’swear. He wanted to find a “novel” item, something that people would wear that was notbeing sold in the stores. For four more days he walked the streets. On the evening ofthe final day as he walked toward home, he saw a half dozen girls playing hopscotch.One of the girls was wearing a tiny embroidered apron over her dress, cut low in thefront with a tie in the back, and it struck him, suddenly, that in his previous days ofrelentlessly inventorying the clothing shops of the Lower East Side, he had never seenone of those aprons for sale.He came home and told Regina. She had an ancient sewing machine that they hadbought upon their arrival in America. The next morning, he went to a dry-goods storeon Hester Street and bought a hundred yards of gingham and fifty yards of whitecrossbar. He came back to their tiny apartment and laid the goods out on the diningroom table. Regina began to cut the gingham—small sizes for toddlers, larger for smallchildren—until she had forty aprons. She began to sew. At midnight, she went to bedand Louis took up where she had left off. At dawn, she rose and began cuttingbuttonholes and adding buttons. By ten in the morning, the aprons were finished. Louisgathered them up over his arm and ventured out onto Hester Street.“Children’s aprons! Little girls’ aprons! Colored ones, ten cents. White ones, fifteencents! Little girls’ aprons!”By one o’clock, all forty were gone.“Ma, we’ve got our business,” he shouted out to Regina, after running all the wayhome from Hester Street.He grabbed her by the waist and began swinging her around and around.“You’ve got to help me,” he cried out. “We’ll work together! Ma, this is ourbusiness.”

Jewish immigrants like the Floms and the Borgenichts and the Janklows were not likethe other immigrants who came to America in the nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies. The Irish and the Italians were peasants, tenant farmers from theimpoverished countryside of Europe. Not so the Jews. For centuries in Europe, theyhad been forbidden to own land, so they had clustered in cities and towns, taking upurban trades and professions. Seventy percent of the Eastern European Jews who camethrough Ellis Island in the thirty years or so before the First World War had some kindof occupational skill. They had owned small groceries or jewelry stores. They had beenbookbinders or watchmakers. Overwhelmingly, though, their experience lay in theclothing trade. They were tailors and dressmakers, hat and cap makers, and furriers andtanners.

Louis Borgenicht, for example, left the impoverished home of his parents at agetwelve to work as a salesclerk in a general store in the Polish town of Brzesko. Whenthe opportunity came to work in Schnittwaren Handlung (literally, the handling of clothand fabrics or “piece goods,” as they were known), he jumped at it. “In those days, thepiece-goods man was clothier to the world,” he writes, “and of the three fundamentalsrequired for life in that simple society, food and shelter were humble. Clothing was thearistocrat. Practitioners of the clothing art, dealers in wonderful cloths from everycorner of Europe, traders who visited the centers of industry on their annual buyingtours—these were the merchant princes of my youth. Their voices were heard, theirweight felt.”Borgenicht worked in piece goods for a man named Epstein, then moved on to astore in neighboring Jaslow called Brandstatter’s. It was there that the youngBorgenicht learned the ins and outs of all the dozens of different varieties of cloth, tothe point where he could run his hand over a fabric and tell you the thread count, thename of the manufacturer, and its place of origin. A few years later, Borgenicht movedto Hungary and met Regina. She had been running a dressmaking business since theage of sixteen. Together they opened a series of small piece-goods stores, painstakinglylearning the details of small-business entrepreneurship.Borgenicht’s great brainstorm that day on the upturned box, then, did not comefrom nowhere. He was a veteran of Schnittwaren Handlung, and his wife was aseasoned dressmaker. This was their field. And at the same time as the Borgenichts setup shop inside their tiny apartment, thousands of other Jewish immigrants were doingthe same thing, putting their sewing and dressmaking and tailoring skills to use, to thepoint where by 1900, control of the garment industry had passed almost entirely intothe hands of the Eastern European newcomers. As Borgenicht puts it, the Jews “bitdeep into the welcoming land and worked like madmen at what they knew.”Today, at a time when New York is at the center of an enormous and diversifiedmetropolitan area, it is easy to forget the significance of the set of skills thatimmigrants like the Borgenichts brought to the New World. From the late nineteenthcentury through the middle of the twentieth century, the garment trade was the largestand most economically vibrant industry in the city. More people worked makingclothes in New York than at anything else, and more clothes were manufactured inNew York than in any other city in the world. The distinctive buildings that still standon the lower half of Broadway in Manhattan—from the big ten- and fifteen-storyindustrial warehouses in the twenty blocks below Times Square to the cast-iron lofts ofSoHo and Tribeca—were almost all built to house coat makers and hatmakers andlingerie manufacturers and huge rooms of men and women hunched over sewingmachines. To come to New York City in the 1890s with a background in dressmakingor sewing or Schnittwaren Handlung was a stroke of extraordinary good fortune. It waslike showing up in Silicon Valley in 1986 with ten thousand hours of computerprogramming already under your belt.“There is no doubt that those Jewish immigrants arrived at the perfect time, with theperfect skills,” says the sociologist Stephen Steinberg. “To exploit that opportunity, youhad to have certain virtues, and those immigrants worked hard. They sacrificed. Theyscrimped and saved and invested wisely. But still, you have to remember that the

garment industry in those years was growing by leaps and bounds. The economy wasdesperate for the skills that they possessed.”Louis and Regina Borgenicht and the thousands of others who came over on theboats with them were given a golden opportunity. And so were their children andgrandchildren, because the lessons those garment workers brought home with them inthe evenings turned out to be critical for getting ahead in the world.
10.
The day after Louis and Regina Borgenicht sold out their first lot of forty aprons, Louismade his way to H. B. Claflin and Company. Claflin was a dry-goods “commission”house, the equivalent of Brandstatter’s back in Poland. There, Borgenicht asked for asalesman who spoke German, since his English was almost nonexistent. He had in hishand his and Regina’s life savings—$12—and with that money, he bought enoughcloth to make ten dozen aprons. Day and night, he and Regina cut and sewed. He soldall ten dozen in two days. Back he went to Claflin for another round. They sold thosetoo. Before long, he and Regina hired another immigrant just off the boat to help withthe children so Regina could sew full-time, and then another to serve as an apprentice.Louis ventured uptown as far as Harlem, selling to the mothers in the tenements. Herented a storefront on Sheriff Street, with living quarters in the back. He hired threemore girls, and bought sewing machines for all of them. He became known as “theapron man.” He and Regina were selling aprons as fast as they could make them.Before long, the Borgenichts decided to branch out. They started making adultaprons, then petticoats, then women’s dresses. By January of 1892, the Borgenichts hadtwenty people working for them, mostly immigrant Jews like themselves. They hadtheir own factory on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and a growing list ofcustomers, including a store uptown owned by another Jewish immigrant family, theBloomingdale brothers. Keep in mind the Borgenichts had been in the country for onlythree years at this point. They barely spoke English. And they weren’t rich yet by anystretch of the imagination. Whatever profit they made got plowed back into theirbusiness, and Borgenicht says he had only $200 in the bank. But already he was incharge of his own destiny.This was the second great advantage of the garment industry. It wasn’t just that itwas growing by leaps and bounds. It was also explicitly entrepreneurial. Clothesweren’t made in a single big factory. Instead, a number of established firms designedpatterns and prepared the fabric, and then the complicated stitching and pressing andbutton attaching were all sent out to small contractors. And if a contractor got bigenough, or ambitious enough, he started designing his own patterns and preparing hisown fabric. By 1913, there were approximately sixteen thousand separate companies inNew York City’s garment business, many just like the Borgenichts’ shop on SheriffStreet.“The threshold for getting involved in the business was very low. It’s basically abusiness built on the sewing machine, and sewing machines don’t cost that much,” saysDaniel Soyer, a historian who has written widely on the garment industry. “So youdidn’t need a lot of capital. At the turn of the twentieth century, it was probably fiftydollars to buy a machine or two. All you had to do to be a contractor was to have a

couple sewing machines, some irons, and a couple of workers. The profit margins werevery low but you could make some money.”Listen to how Borgenicht describes his decision to expand beyond aprons:
From my study of the market I knew that only three men were making children’sdresses in 1890. One was an East Side tailor near me, who made only to order,while the other two turned out an expensive product with which I had no desireat all to compete. I wanted to make “popular price” stuff—wash dresses, silks,and woolens. It was my goal to produce dresses that the great mass of the peoplecould afford, dresses that would—from the business angle—sell equally well toboth large and small, city and country stores. With Regina’s help—she alwayshad excellent taste, and judgment—I made up a line of samples. Displayingthem to all my “old” customers and friends, I hammered home every point—mydresses would save mothers endless work, the materials and sewing were asgood and probably better than anything that could be done at home, the pricewas right for quick disposal.
On one occasion, Borgenicht realized that his only chance to undercut bigger firmswas to convince the wholesalers to sell cloth to him directly, eliminating themiddleman. He went to see a Mr. Bingham at Lawrence and Company, a “tall, gaunt,white-bearded Yankee with steel-blue eyes.” There the two of them were, theimmigrant from rural Poland, his eyes ringed with fatigue, facing off in his haltingEnglish against the imperious Yankee. Borgenicht said he wanted to buy forty cases ofcashmere. Bingham had never before sold to an individual company, let alone ashoestring operation on Sheriff Street.“You have a hell of a cheek coming in here and asking me for favors!” Binghamthundered. But he ended up saying yes.What Borgenicht was getting in his eighteen-hour days was a lesson in the moderneconomy. He was learning market research. He was learning manufacturing. He waslearning how to negotiate with imperious Yankees. He was learning how to plughimself into popular culture in order to understand new fashion trends.The Irish and Italian immigrants who came to New York in the same period didn’thave that advantage. They didn’t have a skill specific to the urban economy. They wentto work as day laborers and domestics and construction workers—jobs where youcould show up for work every day for thirty years and never learn market research andmanufacturing and how to navigate the popular culture and how to negotiate with theYankees, who ran the world.Or consider the fate of the Mexicans who immigrated to California between 1900and the end of the 1920s to work in the fields of the big fruit and vegetable growers.They simply exchanged the life of a feudal peasant in Mexico for the life of a feudalpeasant in California. “The conditions in the garment industry were every bit as bad,”Soyer goes on. “But as a garment worker, you were closer to the center of the industry.If you are working in a field in California, you have no clue what’s happening to theproduce when it gets on the truck. If you are working in a small garment shop, yourwages are low, and your conditions are terrible, and your hours are long, but you can

see exactly what the successful people are doing, and you can see how you can set up
your own job.”*
When Borgenicht came home at night to his children, he may have been tired andpoor and overwhelmed, but he was alive. He was his own boss. He was responsible forhis own decisions and direction. His work was complex: it engaged his mind andimagination. And in his work, there was a relationship between effort and reward: thelonger he and Regina stayed up at night sewing aprons, the more money they made thenext day on the streets.Those three things—autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort andreward—are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to besatisfying. It is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy betweennine and five. It’s whether our work fulfills us. If I offered you a choice between beingan architect for $75,000 a year and working in a tollbooth every day for the rest of yourlife for $100,000 a year, which would you take? I’m guessing the former, because thereis complexity, autonomy, and a relationship between effort and reward in doingcreative work, and that’s worth more to most of us than money.Work that fulfills those three criteria is meaningful. Being a teacher is meaningful.Being a physician is meaningful. So is being an entrepreneur, and the miracle of thegarment industry—as cutthroat and grim as it was—was that it allowed people like the
Borgenichts, just off the boat, to find something meaningful to do as well.* WhenLouis Borgenicht came home after first seeing that child’s apron, he danced a jig. Hehadn’t sold anything yet. He was still penniless and desperate, and he knew that tomake something of his idea was going to require years of backbreaking labor. But hewas ecstatic, because the prospect of those endless years of hard labor did not seemlike a burden to him. Bill Gates had that same feeling when he first sat down at thekeyboard at Lakeside. And the Beatles didn’t recoil in horror when they were told theyhad to play eight hours a night, seven days a week. They jumped at the chance. Hardwork is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes thekind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig.The most important consequence of the miracle of the garment industry, though,was what happened to the children growing up in those homes where meaningful workwas practiced. Imagine what it must have been like to watch the meteoric rise ofRegina and Louis Borgenicht through the eyes of one of their offspring. They learnedthe same lesson that little Alex Williams would learn nearly a century later—a lessoncrucial to those who wanted to tackle the upper reaches of a profession like law ormedicine: if you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind andimagination, you can shape the world to your desires.
11.
In 1982, a sociology graduate student named Louise Farkas went to visit a number ofnursing homes and residential hotels in New York City and Miami Beach. She waslooking for people like the Borgenichts, or, more precisely, the children of people likethe Borgenichts, who had come to New York in the great wave of Jewish immigrationat the turn of the last century. And for each of the people she interviewed, she

constructed a family tree showing what a line of parents and children andgrandchildren and, in some cases, great-grandchildren did for a living.Here is her account of “subject #18”:
A Russian tailor artisan comes to America, takes to the needle trade, works in asweat shop for a small salary. Later takes garments to finish at home with thehelp of his wife and older children. In order to increase his salary he worksthrough the night. Later he makes a garment and sells it on New York streets. Heaccumulates some capital and goes into a business venture with his sons. Theyopen a shop to create men’s garments. The Russian tailor and his sons becomemen’s suit manufacturers supplying several men’s stores…. The sons and thefather become prosperous…. The sons’ children become educated professionals.
Here’s another. It’s a tanner who emigrated from Poland in the late nineteenthcentury.
Farkas’s Jewish family trees go on for pages, each virtually identical to the onebefore, until the conclusion becomes inescapable: Jewish doctors and lawyers did notbecome professionals in spite of their humble origins. They became professionalsbecause of their humble origins.Ted Friedman, the prominent litigator in the 1970s and 1980s, remembers as a childgoing to concerts with his mother at Carnegie Hall. They were poor and living in thefarthest corners of the Bronx. How did they afford tickets? “Mary got a quarter,”Friedman says. “There was a Mary who was a ticket taker, and if you gave Mary aquarter, she would let you stand in the second balcony, without a ticket. Carnegie Halldidn’t know about it. It was just between you and Mary. It was a bit of a journey, but
we would go back once or twice a month.”*
Friedman’s mother was a Russian immigrant. She barely spoke English. But shehad gone to work as a seamstress at the age of fifteen and had become a prominentgarment union organizer, and what you learn in that world is that through your ownpowers of persuasion and initiative, you can take your kids to Carnegie Hall. There isno better lesson for a budding lawyer than that. The garment industry was boot campfor the professions.

What did Joe Flom’s father do? He sewed shoulder pads for women’s dresses. Whatdid Robert Oppenheimer’s father do? He was a garment manufacturer, like LouisBorgenicht. One flight up from Flom’s corner office at Skadden, Arps is the office ofBarry Garfinkel, who has been at Skadden, Arps nearly as long as Flom and who formany years headed the firm’s litigation department. What did Garfinkel’s mother do?She was a milliner. She made hats at home. What did two of Louis and ReginaBorgenicht’s sons do? They went to law school, and no less than nine of theirgrandchildren ended up as doctors and lawyers as well.Here is the most remarkable of Farkas’s family trees. It belongs to a Jewish familyfrom Romania who had a small grocery store in the Old Country and then came to NewYork and opened another, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It is the most elegantanswer to the question of where all the Joe Floms came from.
12.
Ten blocks north of the Skadden, Arps headquarters in midtown Manhattan are theoffices of Joe Flom’s great rival, the law firm generally regarded as the finest in theworld.It is headquartered in the prestigious office building known as Black Rock. To gethired there takes a small miracle. Unlike New York’s other major law firms, all ofwhich have hundreds of attorneys scattered around the major capitals of the world, itoperates only out of that single Manhattan building. It turns down much more businessthan it accepts. Unlike every one of its competitors, it does not bill by the hour. Itsimply names a fee. Once, while defending Kmart against a takeover, the firm billed$20 million for two weeks’ work. Kmart paid—happily. If its attorneys do not outsmartyou, they will outwork you, and if they can’t outwork you, they’ll win through sheerintimidation. There is no firm in the world that has made more money, lawyer forlawyer, over the past two decades. On Joe Flom’s wall, next to pictures of Flom withGeorge Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton, there is a picture of him with the rival firm’smanaging partner.No one rises to the top of the New York legal profession unless he or she is smartand ambitious and hardworking, and clearly the four men who founded the Black Rockfirm fit that description. But we know far more than that, don’t we? Success is not arandom act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances andopportunities, and at this point, after examining the lives of Bill Joy and Bill Gates, prohockey players and geniuses, and Joe Flom, the Janklows, and the Borgenichts, itshouldn’t be hard to figure out where the perfect lawyer comes from.This person will have been born in a demographic trough, so as to have had the bestof New York’s public schools and the easiest time in the job market. He will be Jewish,of course, and so, locked out of the old-line downtown law firms on account of his

“antecedents.” This person’s parents will have done meaningful work in the garmentbusiness, passing on to their children autonomy and complexity and the connectionbetween effort and reward. A good school—although it doesn’t have to be a greatschool—will have been attended. He need not have been the smartest in the class, onlysmart enough.In fact, we can be even more precise. Just as there is a perfect birth date for anineteenth-century business tycoon, and a perfect birth date for a software tycoon,there is a perfect birth date for a New York Jewish lawyer as well. It’s 1930, becausethat would give the lawyer the benefit of a blessedly small generation. It would alsomake him forty years of age in 1970, when the revolution in the legal world first began,which translates to a healthy fifteen-year Hamburg period in the takeover businesswhile the white-shoe lawyers lingered, oblivious, over their two-martini lunches. If youwant to be a great New York lawyer, it is an advantage to be an outsider, and it is anadvantage to have parents who did meaningful work, and, better still, it is an advantageto have been born in the early 1930s. But if you have all three advantages—on top of agood dose of ingenuity and drive—then that’s an unstoppable combination. That’s likebeing a hockey player born on January 1.The Black Rock law firm is Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. The firm’s firstpartner was Herbert Wachtell. He was born in 1931. He grew up in the AmalgamatedClothing Workers union housing across from Van Cortlandt Park, in the Bronx. Hisparents were Jewish immigrants from the Ukraine. His father was in the ladies’undergarment business with his brothers, on the sixth floor of what is now a fancy loftat Broadway and Spring Street in SoHo. He went to New York City public schools inthe 1940s, then to New York University, and then to New York University Law School.The second partner was Martin Lipton. He was born in 1931. His father was amanager at a factory. He was a descendant of Jewish immigrants. He attended publicschools in Jersey City, then the University of Pennsylvania, then New York UniversityLaw School.The third partner was Leonard Rosen. He was born in 1930. He grew up poor in theBronx, near Yankee Stadium. His parents were Jewish immigrants from the Ukraine.His father worked in the garment district in Manhattan as a presser. He went to NewYork City public schools in the 1940s, then to City College in upper Manhattan, andthen to New York University Law School.The fourth partner was George Katz. He was born in 1931. He grew up in a one-bedroom first-floor apartment in the Bronx. His parents were the children of Jewishimmigrants from Eastern Europe. His father sold insurance. His grandfather, who liveda few blocks away, was a sewer in the garment trade, doing piecework out of his house.He went to New York City public schools in the 1940s, then to City College in upperManhattan, and then to New York University Law School.Imagine that we had met any one of these four fresh out of law school, sitting in theelegant waiting room at Mudge Rose next to a blue-eyed Nordic type from the “right”background. We’d all have bet on the Nordic type. And we would have been wrong,because the Katzes and the Rosens and the Liptons and the Wachtells and the Flomshad something that the Nordic type did not. Their world—their culture and generationand family history—gave them the greatest of opportunities.

PART TWO
LEGACY

CHAPTER SIX
Harlan, Kentucky
“DIE LIKE A MAN, LIKE YOUR BROTHER DID!”
1.
In the southeastern corner of Kentucky, in the stretch of the Appalachian
Mountains known as the Cumberland Plateau, lies a small town called
Harlan.
The Cumberland Plateau is a wild and mountainous region of flat-
topped ridges, mountain walls five hundred to a thousand feet high, and
narrow valleys, some wide enough only for a one-lane road and a creek.
When the area was first settled, the plateau was covered with a dense
primeval forest. Giant tulip poplars grew in the coves and at the foot of
the hills, some with trunks as wide as seven or eight feet in diameter.
Alongside them were white oaks, beeches, maples, walnuts, sycamores,
birches, willows, cedars, pines, and hemlocks, all enmeshed in a lattice
of wild grapevine, comprising one of the greatest assortment of forest
trees in the Northern Hemisphere. On the ground were bears and
mountain lions and rattlesnakes; in the treetops, an astonishing array of
squirrels; and beneath the soil, one thick seam after another of coal.
Harlan County was founded in 1819 by eight immigrant families
from the northern regions of the British Isles. They had come to Virginia
in the eighteenth century and then moved west into the Appalachians in
search of land. The county was never wealthy. For its first one hundred
years, it was thinly populated, rarely numbering more than ten thousand
people. The first settlers kept pigs and herded sheep on the hillsides,
scratching out a living on small farms in the valleys. They made whiskey
in backyard stills and felled trees, floating them down the Cumberland
River in the spring, when the water was high. Until well into the
twentieth century, getting to the nearest train station was a two-day

wagon trip. The only way out of town was up Pine Mountain, which was
nine steep miles on a road that turned on occasion into no more than a
muddy, rocky trail. Harlan was a remote and strange place, unknown by
the larger society around it, and it might well have remained so but for
the fact that two of the town’s founding families—the Howards and the
Turners—did not get along.
The patriarch of the Howard clan was Samuel Howard. He built the
town courthouse and the jail. His counterpart was William Turner, who
owned a tavern and two general stores. Once a storm blew down the
fence to the Turner property, and a neighbor’s cow wandered onto their
land. William Turner’s grandson, “Devil Jim,” shot the cow dead. The
neighbor was too terrified to press charges and fled the county. Another
time, a man tried to open a competitor to the Turners’ general store. The
Turners had a word with him. He closed the store and moved to Indiana.
These were not pleasant people.
One night Wix Howard and “Little Bob” Turner—the grandsons of
Samuel and William, respectively—played against each other in a game
of poker. Each accused the other of cheating. They fought. The following
day they met in the street, and after a flurry of gunshots, Little Bob
Turner lay dead with a shotgun blast to the chest. A group of Turners
went to the Howards’ general store and spoke roughly to Mrs. Howard.
She was insulted and told her son Wilse Howard, and the following week
he exchanged gunfire with another of Turner’s grandsons, young Will
Turner, on the road to Hagan, Virginia. That night one of the Turners and
a friend attacked the Howard home. The two families then clashed
outside the Harlan courthouse. In the gunfire, Will Turner was shot and
killed. A contingent of Howards then went to see Mrs. Turner, the
mother of Will Turner and Little Bob, to ask for a truce. She declined:
“You can’t wipe out that blood,” she said, pointing to the dirt where her
son had died.
Things quickly went from bad to worse. Wilse Howard ran into
“Little George” Turner near Sulphur Springs and shot him dead. The
Howards ambushed three friends of the Turners—the Cawoods—killing
all of them. A posse was sent out in search of the Howards. In the
resulting gunfight, six more were killed or wounded. Wilse Howard
heard the Turners were after him, and he and a friend rode into Harlan
and attacked the Turner home. Riding back, the Howards were
ambushed. In the fighting, another person died. Wilse Howard rode to

George Turner’s house and fired at him but missed and killed another
man. A posse surrounded the Howard home. There was another gunfight.
More dead. The county was in an uproar. I think you get the picture.
There were places in nineteenth-century America where people lived in
harmony. Harlan, Kentucky, was not one of them.
“Stop that!” Will Turner’s mother snapped at him when he staggered
home, howling in pain after being shot in the courthouse gun battle with
the Howards. “Die like a man, like your brother did!” She belonged to a
world so well acquainted with fatal gunshots that she had certain
expectations about how they ought to be endured. Will shut his mouth,
and he died.
2.
Suppose you were sent to Harlan in the late nineteenth century to
investigate the causes of the Howard-Turner feud. You lined up every
surviving participant and interviewed them as carefully as you could.
You subpoenaed documents and took depositions and pored over court
records until you had put together a detailed and precise accounting of
each stage in the deadly quarrel.
How much would you know? The answer is, not much. You’d learn
that there were two families in Harlan who didn’t much like each other,
and you’d confirm that Wilse Howard, who was responsible for an awful
lot of the violence, probably belonged behind bars. What happened in
Harlan wouldn’t become clear until you looked at the violence from a
much broader perspective.
The first critical fact about Harlan is that at the same time that the
Howards and the Turners were killing one another, there were almost
identical clashes in other small towns up and down the Appalachians. In
the famous Hatfield-McCoy feud on the West Virginia–Kentucky border
not far from Harlan, several dozen people were killed in a cycle of
violence that stretched over twenty years. In the French-Eversole feud in
Perry County, Kentucky, twelve died, six of them killed by “Bad Tom”
Smith (a man, John Ed Pearce writes in Days of Darkness, who was “just
dumb enough to be fearless, just bright enough to be dangerous, and a
dead shot”). The Martin-Tolliver feud, in Rowan County, Kentucky, in
the mid-1880s featured three gunfights, three ambushes, and two house
attacks, and ended in a two-hour gun battle involving one hundred armed

men. The Baker-Howard feud in Clay County, Kentucky, began in 1806,
with an elk-hunting party gone bad, and didn’t end until the 1930s, when
a couple of Howards killed three Bakers in an ambush.
And these were just the well-known feuds. The Kentucky legislator
Harry Caudill once looked in a circuit court clerk’s office in one
Cumberland Plateau town and found one thousand murder indictments
stretching from the end of the Civil War, in the 1860s, to the beginning
of the twentieth century—and this for a region that never numbered more
than fifteen thousand people and where many violent acts never even
made it to the indictment stage. Caudill writes of a murder trial in
Breathitt County—or “Bloody Breathitt,” as it came to be known—that
ended abruptly when the defendant’s father, “a man of about fifty with
huge handlebar whiskers and two immense pistols,” walked up to the
judge and grabbed his gavel:
The feudist rapped the bench and announced, “Court’s over and
ever’body can go. We ain’t agoin’ to have any court here this
term, folks.” The red-faced judge hastily acquiesced in this
extraordinary order and promptly left town. When court convened
at the next term the court and sheriff were bolstered by sixty
militiamen, but by then the defendant was not available for trial.
He had been slain from ambush.
When one family fights with another, it’s a feud. When lots of
families fight with one another in identical little towns up and down the
same mountain range, it’s a pattern.
What was the cause of the Appalachian pattern? Over the years, many
potential explanations have been examined and debated, and the
consensus appears to be that that region was plagued by a particularly
virulent strain of what sociologists call a “culture of honor.”
Cultures of honor tend to take root in highlands and other marginally
fertile areas, such as Sicily or the mountainous Basque regions of Spain.
If you live on some rocky mountainside, the explanation goes, you can’t
farm. You probably raise goats or sheep, and the kind of culture that
grows up around being a herdsman is very different from the culture that
grows up around growing crops. The survival of a farmer depends on the
cooperation of others in the community. But a herdsman is off by

himself. Farmers also don’t have to worry that their livelihood will be
stolen in the night, because crops can’t easily be stolen unless, of course,
a thief wants to go to the trouble of harvesting an entire field on his own.
But a herdsman does have to worry. He’s under constant threat of ruin
through the loss of his animals. So he has to be aggressive: he has to
make it clear, through his words and deeds, that he is not weak. He has to
be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to his
reputation—and that’s what a “culture of honor” means. It’s a world
where a man’s reputation is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth.
“The critical moment in the development of the young shepherd’s
reputation is his first quarrel,” the ethnographer J. K. Campbell writes of
one herding culture in Greece. “Quarrels are necessarily public. They
may occur in the coffee shop, the village square, or most frequently on a
grazing boundary where a curse or a stone aimed at one of his straying
sheep by another shepherd is an insult which inevitably requires a violent
response.”
So why was Appalachia the way it was? It was because of where the
original inhabitants of the region came from. The so-called American
backcountry states—from the Pennsylvania border south and west
through Virginia and West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, North
Carolina and South Carolina, and the northern end of Alabama and
Georgia—were settled overwhelmingly by immigrants from one of the
world’s most ferocious cultures of honor. They were “Scotch-Irish”—
that is, from the lowlands of Scotland, the northern counties of England,
and Ulster in Northern Ireland.
The borderlands—as this region was known—were remote and
lawless territories that had been fought over for hundreds of years. The
people of the region were steeped in violence. They were herdsmen,
scraping out a living on rocky and infertile land. They were clannish,
responding to the harshness and turmoil of their environment by forming
tight family bonds and placing loyalty to blood above all else. And when
they immigrated to North America, they moved into the American
interior, to remote, lawless, rocky, and marginally fertile places like
Harlan that allowed them to reproduce in the New World the culture of
honor they had created in the Old World.
“To the first settlers, the American backcountry was a dangerous
environment, just as the British borderlands had been,” the historian
David Hackett Fischer writes in Albion’s Seed.

Much of the southern highlands were “debatable lands” in the
border sense of a contested territory without established
government or the rule of law. The borderers were more at home
than others in this anarchic environment, which was well suited to
their family system, their warrior ethic, their farming and herding
economy, their attitudes toward land and wealth and their ideas of
work and power. So well adapted was the border culture to this
environment that other ethnic groups tended to copy it. The ethos
of the North British borders came to dominate this “dark and
bloody ground,” partly by force of numbers, but mainly because it
was a means of survival in a raw and dangerous world.*
The triumph of a culture of honor helps to explain why the pattern of
criminality in the American South has always been so distinctive.
Murder rates are higher there than in the rest of the country. But crimes
of property and “stranger” crimes—like muggings—are lower. As the
sociologist John Shelton Reed has written, “The homicides in which the
South seems to specialize are those in which someone is being killed by
someone he (or often she) knows, for reasons both killer and victim
understand.” Reed adds: “The statistics show that the Southerner who
can avoid arguments and adultery is as safe as any other American, and
probably safer.” In the backcountry, violence wasn’t for economic gain.
It was personal. You fought over your honor.
Many years ago, the southern newspaperman Hodding Carter told the
story of how as a young man he served on a jury. As Reed describes it:
The case before the jury involved an irascible gentleman who
lived next door to a filling station. For several months he had been
the butt of various jokes played by the attendants and the
miscellaneous loafers who hung around the station, despite his
warnings and his notorious short temper. One morning, he
emptied both barrels of his shotgun at his tormenters, killing one,
maiming another permanently, and wounding a third…. When the
jury was polled by the incredulous judge, Carter was the only
juror who recorded his vote as guilty. As one of the others put it,
“He wouldn’t of been much of a man if he hadn’t shot them
fellows.”

Only in a culture of honor would it have occurred to the irascible
gentleman that shooting someone was an appropriate response to a
personal insult. And only in a culture of honor would it have occurred to
a jury that murder—under those circumstances—was not a crime.
I realize that we are often wary of making these kinds of broad
generalizations about different cultural groups—and with good reason.
This is the form that racial and ethnic stereotypes take. We want to
believe that we are not prisoners of our ethnic histories.
But the simple truth is that if you want to understand what happened
in those small towns in Kentucky in the nineteenth century, you have to
go back into the past—and not just one or two generations. You have to
go back two or three or four hundred years, to a country on the other side
of the ocean, and look closely at what exactly the people in a very
specific geographic area of that country did for a living. The “culture of
honor” hypothesis says that it matters where you’re from, not just in
terms of where you grew up or where your parents grew up, but in terms
of where your great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents grew up
and even where your great-great-great-grandparents grew up. That is a
strange and powerful fact. It’s just the beginning, though, because upon
closer examination, cultural legacies turn out to be even stranger and
more powerful than that.
3.
In the early 1990s, two psychologists at the University of Michigan—
Dov Cohen and Richard Nisbett—decided to conduct an experiment on
the culture of honor. They knew that what happened in places like Harlan
in the nineteenth century was, in all likelihood, a product of patterns laid
down in the English borderlands centuries before. But their interest was
in the present day. Was it possible to find remnants of the culture of
honor in the modern era? So they decided to gather together a group of
young men and insult them. “We sat down and tried to figure out what is
the insult that would go to the heart of an eighteen-to-twenty-year-old’s
brain,” Cohen says. “It didn’t take too long to come up with ‘asshole.’ ”
The experiment went like this. The social sciences building at the
University of Michigan has a long, narrow hallway in the basement lined
with filing cabinets. The young men were called into a classroom, one by
one, and asked to fill out a questionnaire. Then they were told to drop off

the questionnaire at the end of the hallway and return to the classroom—
a simple, seemingly innocent academic exercise.
For half the young men, that was it. They were the control group. For
the other half, there was a catch. As they walked down the hallway with
their questionnaire, a man—a confederate of the experimenters—walked
past them and pulled out a drawer in one of the filing cabinets. The
already narrow hallway now became even narrower. As the young men
tried to squeeze by, the confederate looked up, annoyed. He slammed the
filing cabinet drawer shut, jostled the young men with his shoulder, and,
in a low but audible voice, said the trigger word: “Asshole.”
Cohen and Nisbett wanted to measure, as precisely as possible, what
being called that word meant. They looked at the faces of their subjects
and rated how much anger they saw. They shook the young men’s hands
to see if their grip was firmer than usual. They took saliva samples from
the students, both before and after the insult, to see if being called an
asshole caused their levels of testosterone and cortisol—the hormones
that drive arousal and aggression—to go up. Finally they asked the
students to read the following story and supply a conclusion:
It had only been about twenty minutes since they had arrived at
the party when Jill pulled Steve aside, obviously bothered about
something.
“What’s wrong?” asked Steve.
“It’s Larry. I mean, he knows that you and I are engaged, but
he’s already made two passes at me tonight.”
Jill walked back into the crowd, and Steve decided to keep his
eye on Larry. Sure enough, within five minutes, Larry was
reaching over and trying to kiss Jill.
If you’ve been insulted, are you more likely to imagine Steve doing
something violent to Larry?
The results were unequivocal. There were clear differences in how
the young men responded to being called a bad name. For some, the
insult changed their behavior. For some it didn’t. The deciding factor in
how they reacted wasn’t how emotionally secure they were, or whether
they were intellectuals or jocks, or whether they were physically
imposing or not. What mattered—and I think you can guess where this is

headed—was where they were from. Most of the young men from the
northern part of the United States treated the incident with amusement.
They laughed it off. Their handshakes were unchanged. Their levels of
cortisol actually went down, as if they were unconsciously trying to
defuse their own anger. Only a few of them had Steve get violent with
Larry.
But the southerners? Oh, my. They were angry. Their cortisol and
testosterone jumped. Their handshakes got firm. Steve was all over
Larry.
“We even played this game of chicken,” Cohen said. “We sent the
students back down the hallways, and around the corner comes another
confederate. The hallway is blocked, so there’s only room for one of
them to pass. The guy we used was six three, two hundred fifty pounds.
He used to play college football. He was now working as a bouncer in a
college bar. He was walking down the hall in business mode—the way
you walk through a bar when you are trying to break up a fight. The
question was: how close do they get to the bouncer before they get out of
the way? And believe me, they always get out of the way.”
For the northerners, there was almost no effect. They got out of the
way five or six feet beforehand, whether they had been insulted or not.
The southerners, by contrast, were downright deferential in normal
circumstances, stepping aside with more than nine feet to go. But if they
had just been insulted? Less than two feet. Call a southerner an asshole,
and he’s itching for a fight. What Cohen and Nisbett were seeing in that
long hall was the culture of honor in action: the southerners were
reacting like Wix Howard did when Little Bob Turner accused him of
cheating at poker.
4.
That study is strange, isn’t it? It’s one thing to conclude that groups of
people living in circumstances pretty similar to their ancestors’ act a lot
like their ancestors. But those southerners in the hallway study weren’t
living in circumstances similar to their British ancestors. They didn’t
even necessarily have British ancestors. They just happened to have
grown up in the South. None of them were herdsmen. Nor were their
parents herdsmen. They were living in the late twentieth century, not the
late nineteenth century. They were students at the University of

Michigan, in one of the northernmost states in America, which meant
they were sufficiently cosmopolitan to travel hundreds of miles from the
south to go to college. And none of that mattered. They still acted like
they were living in nineteenth-century Harlan, Kentucky.
“Your median student in those studies comes from a family making
over a hundred thousand dollars, and that’s in nineteen ninety dollars,”
Cohen says. “The southerners we see this effect with aren’t kids who
come from the hills of Appalachia. They are more likely to be the sons of
upper-middle management Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta. And that’s
the big question. Why should we get this effect with them? Why should
one get it hundreds of years later? Why are these suburban-Atlanta kids
acting out the ethos of the frontier?”*
*     *     *
Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long
lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as
the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them
have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and
behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them.*
So far in Outliers we’ve seen that success arises out of the steady
accumulation of advantages: when and where you are born, what your
parents did for a living, and what the circumstances of your upbringing
were all make a significant difference in how well you do in the world.
The question for the second part of Outliers is whether the traditions and
attitudes we inherit from our forebears can play the same role. Can we
learn something about why people succeed and how to make people
better at what they do by taking cultural legacies seriously? I think we
can.

CHAPTER SEVEN
The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes
“CAPTAIN, THE WEATHER RADAR HAS HELPED US A LOT.”
1.
On the morning of August 5, 1997, the captain of Korean Air flight 801
woke at six. His family would later tell investigators that he went to the
gym for an hour, then came home and studied the flight plan for that
evening’s journey to Guam. He napped and ate lunch. At three in the
afternoon, he left for Seoul, departing early enough, his wife said, to
continue his preparations at Kimpo International Airport. He had been a
pilot with Korean Air for almost four years after coming over from the
Korean Air Force. He had eighty-nine hundred hours of flight time,
including thirty-two hundred hours of experience in jumbo jets. A few
months earlier, he had been given a flight safety award by his airline for
successfully handling a jumbo-jet engine failure at low altitude. He was
forty-two years old and in excellent health, with the exception of a bout
of bronchitis that had been diagnosed ten days before.
At seven p.m., the captain, his first officer, and the flight engineer
met and collected the trip’s paperwork. They would be flying a Boeing
747—the model known in the aviation world as the “classic.” The
aircraft was in perfect working order. It had once been the Korean
presidential plane. Flight 801 departed the gate at ten-thirty in the
evening and was airborne twenty minutes later. Takeoff was without
incident. Just before one-thirty in the morning, the plane broke out of the
clouds, and the flight crew glimpsed lights off in the distance.
“Is it Guam?” the flight engineer asked. Then, after a pause, he said,
“It’s Guam, Guam.”
The captain chuckled. “Good!”

The first officer reported to Air Traffic Control (ATC) that the
airplane was “clear of Charlie Bravo [cumulonimbus clouds]” and
requested “radar vectors for runway six left.”
The plane began its descent toward Guam airport. They would make
a visual approach, the captain said. He had flown into Guam airport from
Kimpo eight times previously, most recently a month ago, and he knew
the airport and the surrounding terrain well. The landing gear went
down. The flaps were extended ten degrees. At 01:41 and 48 seconds,
the captain said, “Wiper on,” and the flight engineer turned them on. It
was raining. The first officer then said, “Not in sight?” He was looking
for the runway. He couldn’t see it. One second later, the Ground
Proximity Warning System called out in its electronic voice: “Five
hundred [feet].” The plane was five hundred feet off the ground. But how
could that be if they couldn’t see the runway? Two seconds passed. The
flight engineer said, “Eh?” in an astonished tone of voice.
At 01:42 and 19 seconds, the first officer said, “Let’s make a missed
approach,” meaning, Let’s pull up and make a large circle and try the
landing again.
One second later, the flight engineer said, “Not in sight.” The first
officer added, “Not in sight, missed approach.”
At 01:42 and 22 seconds, the flight engineer said again, “Go around.”
At 01:42 and 23 seconds, the captain repeated, “Go around,” but he
was slow to pull the plane out of its descent.
At 01:42 and 26 seconds, the plane hit the side of Nimitz Hill, a
densely vegetated mountain three miles southwest of the airport—$60
million and 212,000 kilograms of steel slamming into rocky ground at
one hundred miles per hour. The plane skidded for two thousand feet,
severing an oil pipeline and snapping pine trees, before falling into a
ravine and bursting into flames. By the time rescue workers reached the
crash site, 228 of the 254 people on board were dead.
2.
Twenty years before the crash of KAL 801, a Korean Air Boeing 707
wandered into Russian airspace and was shot down by a Soviet military
jet over the Barents Sea. It was an accident, meaning the kind of rare and
catastrophic event that, but for the grace of God, could happen to any

airline. It was investigated and analyzed. Lessons were learned. Reports
were filed.
Then, two years later, a Korean Air Boeing 747 crashed in Seoul.
Two accidents in two years is not a good sign. Three years after that, the
airline lost another 747 near Sakhalin Island, in Russia, followed by a
Boeing 707 that went down over the Andaman Sea in 1987, two more
crashes in 1989 in Tripoli and Seoul, and then another in 1994 in Cheju,
South Korea.*
To put that record in perspective, the “loss” rate for an airline like the
American carrier United Airlines in the period 1988 to 1998 was .27 per
million departures, which means that they lost a plane in an accident
about once in every four million flights. The loss rate for Korean Air, in
the same period, was 4.79 per million departures—more than seventeen
times higher.
Korean Air’s planes were crashing so often that when the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)—the US agency responsible for
investigating plane crashes within American jurisdiction—did its report
on the Guam crash, it was forced to include an addendum listing all the
new Korean Air accidents that had happened just since its investigation
began: the Korean Air 747 that crash-landed at Kimpo in Seoul, almost a
year to the day after Guam; the jetliner that overran a runway at Korea’s
Ulsan Airport eight weeks after that; the Korean Air McDonnell Douglas
83 that rammed into an embankment at Pohang Airport the following
March; and then, a month after that, the Korean Air passenger jet that
crashed in a residential area of Shanghai. Had the NTSB waited just a
few more months, it could have added another: the Korean Air cargo
plane that crashed just after takeoff from London’s Stansted airport,
despite the fact that a warning bell went off in the cockpit no fewer than
fourteen times.
In April 1999, Delta Air Lines and Air France suspended their flying
partnership with Korean Air. In short order, the US Army, which
maintains thousands of troops in South Korea, forbade its personnel from
flying with the airline. South Korea’s safety rating was downgraded by
the US Federal Aviation Administration, and Canadian officials informed
Korean Air’s management that they were considering revoking the
company’s overflight and landing privileges in Canadian airspace.
In the midst of the controversy, an outside audit of Korean Air’s
operations was leaked to the public. The forty-page report was quickly

denounced by Korean Air officials as sensationalized and
unrepresentative, but by that point, it was too late to save the company’s
reputation. The audit detailed instances of flight crews smoking
cigarettes on the tarmac during refueling and in the freight area; and
when the plane was in the air. “Crew read newspapers throughout the
flight,” the audit stated, “often with newspapers held up in such a way
that if a warning light came on, it would not be noticed.” The report
detailed bad morale, numerous procedural violations, and the alarming
conclusion that training standards for the 747 “classic” were so poor that
“there is some concern as to whether First Officers on the Classic fleet
could land the aircraft if the Captain became totally incapacitated.”
By the time of the Shanghai crash, the Korean president, Kim Dae-
jung, felt compelled to speak up. “The issue of Korean Air is not a matter
of an individual company but a matter of the whole country,” he said.
“Our country’s credibility is at stake.” Kim then switched the
presidential plane from Korean Air to its newer rival, Asiana.
But then a small miracle happened. Korean Air turned itself around.
Today, the airline is a member in good standing of the prestigious
SkyTeam alliance. Its safety record since 1999 is spotless. In 2006,
Korean Air was given the Phoenix Award by Air Transport World in
recognition of its transformation. Aviation experts will tell you that
Korean Air is now as safe as any airline in the world.
In this chapter, we’re going to conduct a crash investigation: listen to
the “black box” cockpit recorder; examine the flight records; look at the
weather and the terrain and the airport conditions; and compare the
Guam crash with other very similar plane crashes, all in an attempt to
understand precisely how the company transformed itself from the worst
kind of outlier into one of the world’s best airlines. It is a complex and
sometimes strange story. But it turns on a very simple fact, the same fact
that runs through the tangled history of Harlan and the Michigan
students. Korean Air did not succeed—it did not right itself—until it
acknowledged the importance of its cultural legacy.
3.
Plane crashes rarely happen in real life the same way they happen in the
movies. Some engine part does not explode in a fiery bang. The rudder
doesn’t suddenly snap under the force of takeoff. The captain doesn’t

gasp, “Dear God,” as he’s thrown back against his seat. The typical
commercial jetliner—at this point in its stage of development—is about
as dependable as a toaster. Plane crashes are much more likely to be the
result of an accumulation of minor difficulties and seemingly trivial
malfunctions.*
In a typical crash, for example, the weather is poor—not terrible,
necessarily, but bad enough that the pilot feels a little bit more stressed
than usual. In an overwhelming number of crashes, the plane is behind
schedule, so the pilots are hurrying. In 52 percent of crashes, the pilot at
the time of the accident has been awake for twelve hours or more,
meaning that he is tired and not thinking sharply. And 44 percent of the
time, the two pilots have never flown together before, so they’re not
comfortable with each other. Then the errors start—and it’s not just one
error. The typical accident involves seven consecutive human errors. One
of the pilots does something wrong that by itself is not a problem. Then
one of them makes another error on top of that, which combined with the
first error still does not amount to catastrophe. But then they make a third
error on top of that, and then another and another and another and
another, and it is the combination of all those errors that leads to disaster.
These seven errors, furthermore, are rarely problems of knowledge or
flying skill. It’s not that the pilot has to negotiate some critical technical
maneuver and fails. The kinds of errors that cause plane crashes are
invariably errors of teamwork and communication. One pilot knows
something important and somehow doesn’t tell the other pilot. One pilot
does something wrong, and the other pilot doesn’t catch the error. A
tricky situation needs to be resolved through a complex series of steps—
and somehow the pilots fail to coordinate and miss one of them.
“The whole flight-deck design is intended to be operated by two
people, and that operation works best when you have one person
checking the other, or both people willing to participate,” says Earl
Weener, who was for many years chief engineer for safety at Boeing.
“Airplanes are very unforgiving if you don’t do things right. And for a
long time it’s been clear that if you have two people operating the
airplane cooperatively, you will have a safer operation than if you have a
single pilot flying the plane and another person who is simply there to
take over if the pilot is incapacitated.”
Consider, for example, the famous (in aviation circles, anyway) crash
of the Colombian airliner Avianca flight 052 in January of 1990. The

Avianca accident so perfectly illustrates the characteristics of the
“modern” plane crash that it is studied in flight schools. In fact, what
happened to that flight is so similar to what would happen seven years
later in Guam that it’s a good place to start our investigation into the
mystery of Korean Air’s plane crash problem.
The captain of the plane was Laureano Caviedes. His first officer was
Mauricio Klotz. They were en route from Medellin, Colombia, to New
York City’s Kennedy Airport. The weather that evening was poor. There
was a nor’easter up and down the East Coast, bringing with it dense fog
and high winds. Two hundred and three flights were delayed at Newark
Airport. Two hundred flights were delayed at LaGuardia Airport, 161 at
Philadelphia, 53 at Boston’s Logan Airport, and 99 at Kennedy. Because
of the weather, Avianca was held up by Air Traffic Control three times
on its way to New York. The plane circled over Norfolk, Virginia, for
nineteen minutes, above Atlantic City for twenty-nine minutes, and forty
miles south of Kennedy Airport for another twenty-nine minutes.
After an hour and a quarter of delay, Avianca was cleared for landing.
As the plane came in on its final approach, the pilots encountered severe
wind shear. One moment they were flying into a strong headwind,
forcing them to add extra power to maintain their momentum on the
glide down. The next moment, without warning, the headwind dropped
dramatically, and they were traveling much too fast to make the runway.
Typically, the plane would have been flying on autopilot in that situation,
reacting immediately and appropriately to wind shear. But the autopilot
on the plane was malfunctioning, and it had been switched off. At the
last moment, the pilot pulled up, and executed a “go-around.” The plane
did a wide circle over Long Island, and reapproached Kennedy Airport.
Suddenly, one of the plane’s engines failed. Seconds later, a second
engine failed. “Show me the runway!” the pilot cried out, hoping
desperately that he was close enough to Kennedy to somehow glide his
crippled plane to a safe landing. But Kennedy was sixteen miles away.
The 707 slammed into the estate owned by the father of the tennis
champion John McEnroe, in the posh Long Island town of Oyster Bay.
Seventy-three of the 158 passengers aboard died. It took less than a day
for the cause of the crash to be determined: “fuel exhaustion.” There was
nothing wrong with the aircraft. There was nothing wrong with the
airport. The pilots weren’t drunk or high. The plane had run out of gas.

4.
“It’s a classic case,” said Suren Ratwatte, a veteran pilot who has been
involved for years in “human factors” research, which is the analysis of
how human beings interact with complex systems like nuclear power
plants and airplanes. Ratwatte is Sri Lankan, a lively man in his forties
who has been flying commercial jets his entire adult life. We were sitting
in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. He’d just landed a
jumbo jet at Kennedy Airport after a long flight from Dubai. Ratwatte
knew the Avianca case well. He began to tick off the typical crash
preconditions. The nor’easter. The delayed flight. The minor technical
malfunction with the autopilot. The three long holding patterns—which
meant not only eighty minutes of extra flying time but extra flying at low
altitudes, where a plane burns far more fuel than it does in the thin air
high above the clouds.
“They were flying a seven-oh-seven, which is an older airplane and is
very challenging to fly,” Ratwatte said. “That thing is a lot of work. The
flight controls are not hydraulically powered. They are connected by a
series of pulleys and pull rods to the physical metal surfaces of the
airplane. You have to be quite strong to fly that airplane. You heave it
around the sky. It’s as much physical effort as rowing a boat. My current
airplane I fly with my fingertips. I use a joystick. My instruments are
huge. Theirs were the size of coffee cups. And his autopilot was gone. So
the captain had to keep looking around these nine instruments, each the
size of a coffee cup, while his right hand was controlling the speed, and
his left hand was flying the airplane. He was maxed out. He had no
resources left to do anything else. That’s what happens when you’re
tired. Your decision-making skills erode. You start missing things—
things that you would pick up on any other day.”
In the black box recovered from the crash site, Captain Caviedes in
the final hour of the flight is heard to repeatedly ask for the directions
from ATC to be translated into Spanish, as if he no longer had the energy
to make use of his English. On nine occasions, he also asked for
directions to be repeated. “Tell me things louder,” he said right near the
end. “I’m not hearing them.” When the plane was circling for forty
minutes just southeast of Kennedy—when everyone on the flight deck
clearly knew they were running out of fuel—the pilot could easily have
asked to land at Philadelphia, which was just sixty-five miles away. But
he didn’t: it was as if he had locked in on New York. On the aborted

landing, the plane’s Ground Proximity Warning System went off no
fewer than fifteen times, telling the captain that he was bringing in the
plane too low. He seemed oblivious. When he aborted the landing, he
should have circled back around immediately, and he didn’t. He was
exhausted.
Through it all, the cockpit was filled with a heavy silence. Sitting
next to Caviedes was his first officer, Mauricio Klotz, and in the flight
recorder, there are long stretches of nothing but rustling and engine
noise. It was Klotz’s responsibility to conduct all communication with
ATC, which meant that his role that night was absolutely critical. But his
behavior was oddly passive. It wasn’t until the third holding pattern
southwest of Kennedy Airport that Klotz told ATC that he didn’t think
the plane had enough fuel to reach an alternative airport. The next thing
the crew heard from ATC was “Just stand by” and, following that,
“Cleared to the Kennedy airport.” Investigators later surmised that the
Avianca pilots must have assumed that ATC was jumping them to the
head of the queue, in front of the dozens of other planes circling
Kennedy. In fact, they weren’t. They were just being added to the end of
the line. It was a crucial misunderstanding, upon which the fate of the
plane would ultimately rest. But did the pilots raise the issue again,
looking for clarification? No. Nor did they bring up the issue of fuel
again for another thirty-eight minutes.
5.
To Ratwatte, the silence in the cockpit made no sense. And as a way of
explaining why, Ratwatte began to talk about what had happened to him
that morning on the way over from Dubai. “We had this lady in the
back,” he said. “We reckon she was having a stroke. Seizing. Vomiting.
In bad shape. She was an Indian lady whose daughter lives in the States.
Her husband spoke no English, no Hindi, only Punjabi. No one could
communicate with him. He looked like he had just walked off a village
in the Punjab, and they had absolutely no money. I was actually over
Moscow when it happened, but I knew we couldn’t go to Moscow. I
didn’t know what would happen to these people if we did. I said to the
first officer, ‘You fly the plane. We have to go to Helsinki.’ ”
The immediate problem Ratwatte faced was that they were less than
halfway through a very long flight, which meant that they had far more

fuel in their tanks than they usually do when it comes time to land. “We
were sixty tons over maximum landing weight,” he said. “So now I had
to make a choice. I could dump the fuel. But countries hate it when you
dump fuel. It’s messy stuff and they would have routed me somewhere
over the Baltic Sea, and it would have taken me forty minutes and the
lady probably would have died. So I decided to land anyway. My
choice.”
That meant the plane was “landing heavy.” They couldn’t use the
automated landing system because it wasn’t set up to handle a plane with
that much weight.
“At that stage, I took over the controls,” he went on. “I had to ensure
that the airplane touched down very softly; otherwise, there would have
been the risk of structural damage. It could have been a real mess. There
are also performance issues with being heavy. If you clear the runway
and have to go around, you may not have enough thrust to climb back
up.
“It was a lot of work. You’re juggling a lot of balls. You’ve got to get
it right. Because it was a long flight, there were two other pilots. So I got
them up, and they got involved in doing everything as well. We had four
people up there, which really helped in coordinating everything. I’d
never been to Helsinki before. I had no idea how the airport was, no idea
whether the runways were long enough. I had to find an approach, figure
out if we could land there, figure out the performance parameters, and
tell the company what we were doing. At one point I was talking to three
different people—talking to Dubai, talking to MedLink, which is a
service in Arizona where they put a doctor on call, and I was talking to
the two doctors who were attending to the lady in the back. It was
nonstop for forty minutes.
“We were lucky the weather was very good in Helsinki,” he said.
“Trying to do an approach in bad weather, plus a heavy plane, plus an
unfamiliar airport, that’s not good. Because it was Finland, a first-world
country, they were well set up, very flexible. I said to them, ‘I’m heavy. I
would like to land into the wind.’ You want to slow yourself down in that
situation. They said, No problem. They landed us in the opposite
direction than they normally use. We came in over the city, which they
usually avoid for noise reasons.”
Think about what was required of Ratwatte. He had to be a good
pilot. That much goes without saying: he had to have the technical skill

to land heavy. But almost everything else Ratwatte did that made that
emergency landing a success fell outside the strict definition of piloting
skills.
He had to weigh the risk of damaging his plane against the risk to the
woman’s life, and then, once that choice was made, he had to think
through the implications of Helsinki versus Moscow for the sick
passenger in the back. He had to educate himself, quickly, on the
parameters of an airport he had never seen before: could it handle one of
the biggest jets in the sky, at sixty tons over its normal landing weight?
But most of all, he had to talk—to the passengers, to the doctors, to his
copilot, to the second crew he woke up from their nap, to his superiors
back home in Dubai, to ATC at Helsinki. It is safe to say that in the forty
minutes that passed between the passenger’s stroke and the landing in
Helsinki, there were no more than a handful of seconds of silence in the
cockpit. What was required of Ratwatte was that he communicate, and
communicate not just in the sense of issuing commands but also in the
sense of encouraging and cajoling and calming and negotiating and
sharing information in the clearest and most transparent manner possible.

Here, by contrast, is the transcript from Avianca 052, as the plane is
going in for its abortive first landing. The issue is the weather. The fog is
so thick that Klotz and Caviedes cannot figure out where they are. Pay
close attention, though, not to the content of their conversation but to the
form. In particular, note the length of the silences between utterances and
to the tone of Klotz’s remarks.
CAVIEDES: The runway, where is it? I don’t see it. I don’t see it.
They take up the landing gear. The captain tells Klotz to ask for
another traffic pattern. Ten seconds pass.
CAVIEDES [SEEMINGLY TO HIMSELF]: We don’t have fuel…
Seventeen seconds pass as the pilots give technical instructions to
each other.

CAVIEDES: I don’t know what happened with the runway. I didn’t see
it.
KLOTZ: I didn’t see it.
Air Traffic Control comes in and tells them to make a left turn.
CAVIEDES: Tell them we are in an emergency!
KLOTZ [TO ATC]: That’s right to one-eight-zero on the heading and,
ah, we’ll try once again. We’re running out of fuel.
Imagine the scene in the cockpit. The plane is dangerously low on
fuel. They have just blown their first shot at a landing. They have no idea
how much longer the plane is capable of flying. The captain is desperate:
“Tell them we are in an emergency!” And what does Klotz say? That’s
right to one-eight-zero on the heading and, ah, we’ll try once again.
We’re running out of fuel.
To begin with, the phrase “running out of fuel” has no meaning in Air
Traffic Control terminology. All planes, as they approach their
destination, are by definition running out of fuel. Did Klotz mean that
052 no longer had enough fuel to make it to another, alternative airport?
Did he mean that they were beginning to get worried about their fuel?
Next, consider the structure of the critical sentence. Klotz begins with a
routine acknowledgment of the instructions from ATC and doesn’t
mention his concern about fuel until the second half of the sentence. It’s
as if he were to say in a restaurant, “Yes, I’ll have some more coffee and,
ah, I’m choking on a chicken bone.” How seriously would the waiter
take him? The air traffic controller with whom Klotz was speaking
testified later that he “just took it as a passing comment.” On stormy
nights, air traffic controllers hear pilots talking about running out of fuel
all the time. Even the “ah” that Klotz inserts between the two halves of
his sentence serves to undercut the importance of what he is saying.
According to another of the controllers who handled 052 that night,
Klotz spoke “in a very nonchalant manner…. There was no urgency in
the voice.”
7.

The term used by linguists to describe what Klotz was engaging in in
that moment is “mitigated speech,” which refers to any attempt to
downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said. We mitigate
when we’re being polite, or when we’re ashamed or embarrassed, or
when we’re being deferential to authority. If you want your boss to do
you a favor, you don’t say, “I’ll need this by Monday.” You mitigate. You
say, “Don’t bother, if it’s too much trouble, but if you have a chance to
look at this over the weekend, that would be wonderful.” In a situation
like that, mitigation is entirely appropriate. In other situations, however
—like a cockpit on a stormy night—it’s a problem.
The linguists Ute Fischer and Judith Orasanu once gave the following
hypothetical scenario to a group of captains and first officers and asked
them how they would respond:
You notice on the weather radar an area of heavy precipitation 25
miles ahead. [The pilot] is maintaining his present course at Mach
.73, even though embedded thunderstorms have been reported in
your area and you encounter moderate turbulence. You want to
ensure that your aircraft will not penetrate this area.
Question: what do you say to the pilot?
In Fischer’s and Orasanu’s minds, there were at least six ways to try to
persuade the pilot to change course and avoid the bad weather, each with
a different level of mitigation.
1. Command: “Turn thirty degrees right.” That’s the most direct and
explicit way of making a point imaginable. It’s zero mitigation.
2. Crew Obligation Statement: “I think we need to deviate right about
now.” Notice the use of “we” and the fact that the request is now
much less specific. That’s a little softer.
3. Crew Suggestion: “Let’s go around the weather.” Implicit in that
statement is “we’re in this together.”
4. Query: “Which direction would you like to deviate?” That’s even
softer than a crew suggestion, because the speaker is conceding that
he’s not in charge.
5. Preference: “I think it would be wise to turn left or right.”

6. Hint: “That return at twenty-five miles looks mean.” This is the
most mitigated statement of all.
Fischer and Orasanu found that captains overwhelmingly said they
would issue a command in that situation: “Turn thirty degrees right.”
They were talking to a subordinate. They had no fear of being blunt. The
first officers, on the other hand, were talking to their boss, and so they
overwhelmingly chose the most mitigated alternative. They hinted.
It’s hard to read Fischer and Orasanu’s study and not be just a little bit
alarmed, because a hint is the hardest kind of request to decode and the
easiest to refuse. In the 1982 Air Florida crash outside Washington, DC,
the first officer tried three times to tell the captain that the plane had a
dangerous amount of ice on its wings. But listen to how he says it. It’s all
hints:
FIRST OFFICER: Look how the ice is just hanging on his, ah, back,
back there, see that?
Then:
FIRST OFFICER: See all those icicles on the back there and everything?
And then:
FIRST OFFICER: Boy, this is a, this is a losing battle here on trying to
de-ice those things, it [gives] you a false feeling of security, that’s
all that does.
Finally, as they get clearance for takeoff, the first officer upgrades
two notches to a crew suggestion:
FIRST OFFICER: Let’s check those [wing] tops again, since we’ve been
setting here awhile.
CAPTAIN: I think we get to go here in a minute.

The last thing the first officer says to the captain, just before the plane
plunges into the Potomac River, is not a hint, a suggestion, or a
command. It’s a simple statement of fact—and this time the captain
agrees with him.
FIRST OFFICER: Larry, we’re going down, Larry.
CAPTAIN: I know it.
Mitigation explains one of the great anomalies of plane crashes. In
commercial airlines, captains and first officers split the flying duties
equally. But historically, crashes have been far more likely to happen
when the captain is in the “flying seat.” At first that seems to make no
sense, since the captain is almost always the pilot with the most
experience. But think about the Air Florida crash. If the first officer had
been the captain, would he have hinted three times? No, he would have
commanded—and the plane wouldn’t have crashed. Planes are safer
when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it means the second
pilot isn’t going to be afraid to speak up.
Combating mitigation has become one of the great crusades in
commercial aviation in the past fifteen years. Every major airline now
has what is called “Crew Resource Management” training, which is
designed to teach junior crew members how to communicate clearly and
assertively. For example, many airlines teach a standardized procedure
for copilots to challenge the pilot if he or she thinks something has gone
terribly awry. (“Captain, I’m concerned about…” Then, “Captain, I’m
uncomfortable with…” And if the captain still doesn’t respond,
“Captain, I believe the situation is unsafe.” And if that fails, the first
officer is required to take over the airplane.) Aviation experts will tell
you that it is the success of this war on mitigation as much as anything
else that accounts for the extraordinary decline in airline accidents in
recent years.
“On a very simple level, one of the things we insist upon at my airline
is that the first officer and the captain call each other by their first
names,” Ratwatte said. “We think that helps. It’s just harder to say,
‘Captain, you’re doing something wrong,’ than to use a name.” Ratwatte
took mitigation very seriously. You couldn’t be a student of the Avianca
crash and not feel that way. He went on: “One thing I personally try to do
is, I try to put myself a little down. I say to my copilots, ‘I don’t fly very

often. Three or four times a month. You fly a lot more. If you see me
doing something stupid, it’s because I don’t fly very often. So tell me.
Help me out.’ Hopefully, that helps them speak up.”

Back to the cockpit of Avianca 052. The plane is now turning away from
Kennedy, after the aborted first attempt at landing. Klotz has just been on
the radio with ATC, trying to figure out when they can try to land again.
Caviedes turns to him.
CAVIEDES: What did he say?
KLOTZ: I already advise him that we are going to attempt again
because we now we can’t…”
Four seconds of silence pass.
CAVIEDES: Advise him we are in emergency.
Four more seconds of silence pass. The captain tries again.
CAVIEDES: Did you tell him?
KLOTZ: Yes, sir. I already advise him.
Klotz starts talking to ATC—going over routine details.
KLOTZ: One-five-zero maintaining two thousand Avianca zero-five-
two heavy.
The captain is clearly at the edge of panic.
CAVIEDES: Advise him we don’t have fuel.
Klotz gets back on the radio with ATC.

KLOTZ: Climb and maintain three thousand and, ah, we’re running out
of fuel, sir.
There it is again. No mention of the magic word “emergency,” which
is what air traffic controllers are trained to listen for. Just “running out of
fuel, sir” at the end of a sentence, preceded by the mitigating “ah.” If
you’re counting errors, the Avianca crew is now in double digits.
CAVIEDES: Did you already advise that we don’t have fuel?
KLOTZ: Yes, sir. I already advise him…
CAVIEDES: Bueno.
If it were not the prelude to a tragedy, their back-and-forth would
resemble an Abbott and Costello comedy routine.
A little over a minute passes.
ATC: And Avianca zero-five-two heavy, ah, I’m gonna bring you
about fifteen miles northeast and then turn you back onto the
approach. Is that okay with you and your fuel?
KLOTZ: I guess so. Thank you very much.
I guess so. Thank you very much. They are about to crash! One of the
flight attendants enters the cockpit to find out how serious the situation
is. The flight engineer points to the empty fuel gauge, and makes a
throat-cutting gesture with his finger.* But he says nothing. Nor does
anyone else for the next five minutes. There’s radio chatter and routine
business, and then the flight engineer cries out, “Flameout on engine
number four!”
Caviedes says, “Show me the runway,” but the runway is sixteen
miles away.
Thirty-six seconds of silence pass. The plane’s air traffic controller
calls out one last time.
ATC: You have, ah, you have enough fuel to make it to the airport?
The transcript ends.

“The thing you have to understand about that crash,” Ratwatte said, “is
that New York air traffic controllers are famous for being rude,
aggressive, and bullying. They are also very good. They handle a
phenomenal amount of traffic in a very constrained environment. There
is a famous story about a pilot who got lost trafficking around JFK. You
have no idea how easy that is to do at JFK once you’re on the ground.
It’s a maze. Anyway, a female controller got mad at him, and said, ‘Stop.
Don’t do anything. Do not talk to me until I talk to you.’ And she just
left him there. Finally the pilot picks up the microphone and says,
‘Madam. Was I married to you in a former life?’
“They are unbelievable. The way they look at it, it’s ‘I’m in control.
Shut up and do what I say.’ They will snap at you. And if you don’t like
what they tell you to do, you have to snap back. And then they’ll say,
‘All right, then.’ But if you don’t, they’ll railroad you. I remember a
British Airways flight was going into New York. They were being
stuffed around by New York Air Traffic Control. The British pilots said,
‘You people should go to Heathrow and learn how to control an
airplane.’ It’s all in the spirit. If you are not used to that sort of give-and-
take, New York ATC can be very, very intimidating. And those Avianca
guys were just intimidated by the rapid fire.”
It is impossible to imagine Ratwatte not making his case to Kennedy
ATC—not because he is obnoxious or pushy or has an enormous ego, but
because he sees the world differently. If he needed help in the cockpit, he
would wake up the second crew. If he thought Moscow was wrong, well,
he would just go to Helsinki, and if Helsinki was going to bring him in
with the wind, well, he was going to talk them into bringing him in
against the wind. That morning, when they were leaving Helsinki, he had
lined up the plane on the wrong runway—and his first officer had
quickly pointed out the error. The memory made Ratwatte laugh. “Masa
is Swiss. He was very happy to correct me. He was giving me shit the
whole way back.”
Ratwatte continued: “All the guys had to do was tell the controller,
‘We don’t have the fuel to comply with what you are trying to do.’ All
they had to do was say, ‘We can’t do that. We have to land in the next ten
minutes.’ They weren’t able to put that across to the controller.”
It was at this point that Ratwatte began to speak carefully, because he
was about to make the kind of cultural generalization that often leaves us

uncomfortable. But what happened with Avianca was just so strange—so
seemingly inexplicable—that it demanded a more complete explanation
than simply that Klotz was incompetent and the captain was tired. There
was something more profound—more structural—going on in that
cockpit. What if there was something about the pilots’ being Colombian
that led to that crash? “Look, no American pilot would put up with that.
That’s the thing,” Ratwatte said. “They would say, ‘Listen, buddy. I have
to land.’ ”
10.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede was
working for the human resources department of IBM’s European
headquarters. Hofstede’s job was to travel the globe and interview
employees, asking about such things as how people solved problems and
how they worked together and what their attitudes were to authority. The
questionnaires were long and involved, and over time Hofstede was able
to develop an enormous database for analyzing the ways in which
cultures differ from one another. Today “Hofstede’s Dimensions” are
among the most widely used paradigms in crosscultural psychology.
Hofstede argued, for example, that cultures can be usefully
distinguished according to how much they expect individuals to look
after themselves. He called that measurement the “individualism-
collectivism scale.” The country that scores highest on the individualism
end of that scale is the United States. Not surprisingly, the United States
is also the only industrialized country in the world that does not provide
its citizens with universal health care. At the opposite end of the scale is
Guatemala.
Another of Hofstede’s dimensions is “uncertainty avoidance.” How
well does a culture tolerate ambiguity? Here are the top five “uncertainty
avoidance” countries, according to Hofstede’s database—that is, the
countries most reliant on rules and plans and most likely to stick to
procedure regardless of circumstances:
1. Greece
2. Portugal
3. Guatemala
4. Uruguay

5. Belgium
The bottom five—that is, the cultures best able to tolerate ambiguity
—are:
49. Hong Kong
50. Sweden
51. Denmark
52. Jamaica
53. Singapore
It is important to note that Hofstede wasn’t suggesting that there was
a right place or a wrong place to be on any one of these scales. Nor was
he saying that a culture’s position on one of his dimensions was an
ironclad predictor of how someone from that country behaves: it’s not
impossible, for example, for someone from Guatemala to be highly
individualistic.
What he was saying, instead, was something very similar to what
Nisbett and Cohen argued after their hallway studies at the University of
Michigan. Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But
overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes
handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and
those differences are extraordinarily specific.
Belgium and Denmark are only an hour or so apart by airplane, for
example. Danes look a lot like Belgians, and if you were dropped on a
street corner in Copenhagen, you wouldn’t find it all that different from a
street corner in Brussels. But when it comes to uncertainty avoidance,
the two nations could not be further apart. In fact, Danes have more in
common with Jamaicans when it comes to tolerating ambiguity than they
do with some of their European peers. Denmark and Belgium may share
in a kind of broad European liberal-democratic tradition, but they have
different histories, different political structures, different religious
traditions, and different languages and food and architecture and
literature—going back hundreds and hundreds of years. And the sum
total of all those differences is that in certain kinds of situations that
require dealing with risk and uncertainty, Danes tend to react in a very
different way from Belgians.

Of all of Hofstede’s Dimensions, though, perhaps the most interesting
is what he called the “Power Distance Index” (PDI). Power distance is
concerned with attitudes toward hierarchy, specifically with how much a
particular culture values and respects authority. To measure it, Hofstede
asked questions like “How frequently, in your experience, does the
following problem occur: employees being afraid to express
disagreement with their managers?” To what extent do the “less powerful
members of organizations and institutions accept and expect that power
is distributed unequally?” How much are older people respected and
feared? Are power holders entitled to special privileges?
“In low–power distance index countries,” Hofstede wrote in his
classic text Culture’s Consequences:
power is something of which power holders are almost ashamed
and they will try to underplay. I once heard a Swedish (low PDI)
university official state that in order to exercise power he tried not
to look powerful. Leaders may enhance their informal status by
renouncing formal symbols. In (low PDI) Austria, Prime Minister
Bruno Kreisky was known to sometimes take the streetcar to
work. In 1974, I actually saw the Dutch (low PDI) prime minister,
Joop den Uyl, on vacation with his motor home at a camping site
in Portugal. Such behavior of the powerful would be very unlikely
in high-PDI Belgium or France.*
You can imagine the effect that Hofstede’s findings had on people in
the aviation industry. What was their great battle over mitigated speech
and teamwork all about, after all? It was an attempt to reduce power
distance in the cockpit. Hofstede’s question about power distance
—“How frequently, in your experience, does the following problem
occur: employees being afraid to express disagreement with their
managers?”—was the very question aviation experts were asking first
officers in their dealings with captains. And Hofstede’s work suggested
something that had not occurred to anyone in the aviation world: that the
task of convincing first officers to assert themselves was going to depend
an awful lot on their culture’s power distance rating.
That’s what Ratwatte meant when he said that no American would
have been so fatally intimidated by the controllers at Kennedy Airport.

America is a classic low–power distance culture. When push comes to
shove, Americans fall back on their American-ness, and that American-
ness means that the air traffic controller is thought of as an equal. But
what country is at the other end of the power distance scale? Colombia.
In the wake of the Avianca crash, the psychologist Robert Helmreich,
who has done more than anyone to argue for the role of culture in
explaining pilot behavior, wrote a brilliant analysis of the accident in
which he argued that you couldn’t understand Klotz’s behavior without
taking into account his nationality, that his predicament that day was
uniquely the predicament of someone who had a deep and abiding
respect for authority. Helmreich wrote:
The high–power distance of Colombians could have created
frustration on the part of the first officer because the captain failed
to show the kind of clear (if not autocratic) decision making
expected in high–power distance cultures. The first and second
officers may have been waiting for the captain to make decisions,
but still may have been unwilling to pose alternatives.
Klotz sees himself as a subordinate. It’s not his job to solve the crisis.
It’s the captain’s—and the captain is exhausted and isn’t saying anything.
Then there’s the domineering Kennedy Airport air traffic controllers
ordering the planes around. Klotz is trying to tell them he’s in trouble.
But he’s using his own cultural language, speaking as a subordinate
would to a superior. The controllers, though, aren’t Colombian. They’re
low–power distance New Yorkers. They don’t see any hierarchical gap
between themselves and the pilots in the air, and to them, mitigated
speech from a pilot doesn’t mean the speaker is being appropriately
deferential to a superior. It means the pilot doesn’t have a problem.
There is a point in the transcript where the cultural
miscommunication between the controllers and Klotz becomes so
evident that it is almost painful to read. It’s the last exchange between
Avianca and the control tower, just minutes before the crash. Klotz has
just said, “I guess so. Thank you very much” in response to the
controller’s question about their fuel state. Captain Caviedes then turns
to Klotz.

CAVIEDES: What did he say?
KLOTZ: The guy is angry.
Angry! Klotz’s feelings are hurt! His plane is moments from disaster. But
he cannot escape the dynamic dictated to him by his culture in which
subordinates must respect the dictates of their superiors. In his mind, he
has tried and failed to communicate his plight, and his only conclusion is
that he must have somehow offended his superiors in the control tower.
In the aftermath of the Kennedy crash, the management of Avianca
airlines held a postmortem. Avianca had just had four accidents in quick
succession—Barranquilla, Cucuta, Madrid, and New York—and all four
cases, the airline concluded, “had to do with airplanes in perfect flight
condition, aircrew without physical limitations and considered of
average or above-average flight ability, and still the accidents happened.”
(italics mine)
In the company’s Madrid crash, the report went on, the copilot tried
to warn the captain about how dangerous the situation was:
The copilot was right. But they died because… when the copilot
asked questions, his implied suggestions were very weak. The
captain’s reply was to ignore him totally. Perhaps the copilot did
not want to appear rebellious, questioning the judgment of the
captain, or he did not want to play the fool because he knew that
the pilot had a great deal of experience flying in that area. The
copilot should have advocated for his own opinions in a stronger
way…
Our ability to succeed at what we do is powerfully bound up with
where we’re from, and being a good pilot and coming from a high–
power distance culture is a difficult mix. Colombia by no means has the
highest PDI, by the way. Helmreich and a colleague, Ashleigh Merritt,
once measured the PDI of pilots from around the world. Number one
was Brazil. Number two was South Korea.*

The National Transportation Safety Board, the US agency responsible
for investigating plane crashes, is headquartered in a squat, seventies-era
office building on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington, DC.
Off the agency’s long hallways are laboratories filled with airplane
wreckage: a mangled piece of an engine turbine, a problematic piece of a
helicopter rotor. On a shelf in one of the laboratories is the cockpit voice
and data recorder—the so-called black box—from the devastating
ValuJet crash in Florida in 1996, in which 110 people were killed. The
recorder is encased in a shoe box–size housing made out of thick
hardened steel, and on one end of the box is a jagged hole, as if someone
—or, rather, something—had driven a stake into it with tremendous
force. Some of the NTSB investigators are engineers, who reconstruct
crashes from the material evidence. Others are pilots. A surprising
number of them, however, are psychologists, whose job it is to listen to
the cockpit recorder and reconstruct what was said and done by the flight
crew in the final minutes before a crash. One of the NTSB’s leading
black-box specialists is a gangly fiftyish PhD psychologist named
Malcolm Brenner, and Brenner was one of the investigators into the
Korean Air crash in Guam.
“Normally that approach into Guam is not difficult,” Brenner began.
Guam airport has what is called a glide scope, which is like a giant beam
of light stretching up into the sky from the airport, and the pilot simply
follows the beam all the way down to the runway. But on this particular
night, the glide slope was down. “It was out of service,” Brenner said. “It
had been sent to another island to be repaired. So there was a notice to
airmen that the glide slope was not operating.”
In the grand scheme of things, this should not have been a big
problem. In the month the glide scope had been under repair, there had
been about fifteen hundred safe landings at Guam airport. It was just a
small thing—an inconvenience, really—that made the task of landing a
plane just a little bit more difficult.
“The second complication was the weather,” Brenner continued.
“Normally in the South Pacific, you’ve got these brief weather situations.
But they go by quickly. You don’t have storms. It’s a tropical paradise.
But that night, there were some little cells, and it just happens that that
evening, they were going to be flying into one of those little cells, a few
miles from the airport. So the captain has to decide, What exactly is my
procedure for landing? Well, they were cleared for what’s called a

VOR/DME approach. It’s complicated. It’s a pain in the ass. It takes a lot
of coordination to set it up. You have to come down in steps. But then, as
it happens, from miles out, the captain sees the lights of Guam. So he
relaxes. And he says, ‘We’re doing a visual approach.’ ”
The VOR is a beacon that sends out a signal that allows pilots to
calculate their altitude as they approach an airport. It’s what pilots relied
on before the invention of the glide scope. The captain’s strategy was to
use the VOR to get the plane close and then, once he could see the lights
of the runway, to land the plane visually. It seemed to make sense. Pilots
do visual landings all the time. But every time a pilot chooses a plan, he
is supposed to prepare a backup in case things go awry. And this captain
didn’t.
“They should have been coordinating. He should have been briefing
for the [DME] step-downs,” Brenner went on. “But he doesn’t talk about
that. The storm cells are all around them, and what the captain seems to
be doing is assuming that at some point he’s going to break out of the
clouds and see the airport, and if he doesn’t see it by five hundred sixty
feet, he’ll just go around. Now, that would work, except for one more
thing. The VOR on which he’s basing this strategy is not at the airport.
It’s two-point-five miles away on Nimitz Hill. There’s a number of
airports in the world where this is true. Sometimes you can follow the
VOR down and it takes you straight to the airport. Here if you follow the
VOR down, it takes you straight to Nimitz Hill.”
The pilot knew about the VOR. It was clearly stated in the airport’s
navigational charts. He’d flown into Guam eight times before, and in
fact, he had specifically mentioned it in the briefing he gave before
takeoff. But then again, it was one in the morning, and he’d been up
since six a.m. the previous day.
“We believe that fatigue was involved,” Brenner went on. “It’s a
back-of-the-clock flight. You fly in and arrive at one in the morning,
Korean time. Then you spend a few hours on the ground, and you fly
back as the sun is coming up. The captain has flown it a month before. In
that case, he slept on the first-class seat. Now he’s flying in and says he’s
really tired.”
So there they are, three classic preconditions of a plane crash, the
same three that set the stage for Avianca 052: a minor technical
malfunction; bad weather; and a tired pilot. By itself, none of these
would be sufficient for an accident. But all three in combination require

the combined efforts of everyone in the cockpit. And that’s where
Korean Air 801 ran into trouble.
12.
Here is the flight recorder transcript of the final thirty minutes of KAL
flight 801: It begins with the captain complaining of exhaustion.
0120:01. CAPTAIN: If this round-trip is more than a nine-hour trip, we
might get a little something. With eight hours, we get nothing.
Eight hours do not help us at all…. They make us work to
maximum, up to maximum. Probably this way… hotel expenses
will be saved for cabin crews, and maximize the flight hours.
Anyway, they make us… work to maximum.
There is the sound of a man shifting in his seat. A minute passes.
0121:13. CAPTAIN: Eh… really… sleepy. [unintelligible words]
FIRST OFFICER: Of course.
Then comes one of the most critical moments in the flight. The first
officer decides to speak up:
FIRST OFFICER: Don’t you think it rains more? In this area, here?
The first officer must have thought long and hard before making that
comment. He was not flying in the easy collegiality of Suren Ratwatte’s
cockpit. Among Korean Air flight crews, the expectation on layovers
used to be that the junior officers would attend to the captain to the point
of making him dinner or purchasing him gifts. As one former Korean Air
pilot puts it, the sensibility in many of the airline’s cockpits was that “the
captain is in charge and does what he wants, when he likes, how he likes,
and everyone else sits quietly and does nothing.” In the Delta report on
Korean Air that was posted anonymously on the Internet, one of the
auditors tells a story of sitting in on a Korean Air flight where the first
officer got confused while listening to Air Traffic Control and
mistakenly put the plane on a course intended for another plane. “The

Flight Engineer picked up something was wrong but said nothing. First
Officer was also not happy but said nothing…. Despite [good] visual
conditions, crew did not look out and see that current heading would not
bring them to the airfield.” Finally the plane’s radar picks up the mistake,
and then comes the key sentence: “Captain hit First Officer with the back
of his hand for making the error.”
Hit him with the back of his hand?
When the three pilots all met that evening at Kimpo for their preflight
preparation, the first officer and the engineer would have bowed to the
captain. They would all have then shaken hands. “Cheo eom boeb seom
ni da,” the copilot might have said, respectfully. “It is first time to meet
you.” The Korean language has no fewer than six different levels of
conversational address, depending on the relationship between the
addressee and the addresser: formal deference, informal deference, blunt,
familiar, intimate, and plain. The first officer would not have dared to
use one of the more intimate or familiar forms when he addressed the
captain. This is a culture in which enormous attention is paid to the
relative standing of any two people in a conversation.
The Korean linguist Ho-min Sohn writes:
At a dinner table, a lower-ranking person must wait until a higher-
ranking person sits down and starts eating, while the reverse does
not hold true; one does not smoke in the presence of a social
superior; when drinking with a social superior, the subordinate
hides his glass and turns away from the superior;… in greeting a
social superior (though not an inferior) a Korean must bow; a
Korean must rise when an obvious social superior appears on the
scene, and he cannot pass in front of an obvious social superior.
All social behavior and actions are conducted in the order of
seniority or ranking; as the saying goes, chanmul to wi alay ka ita,
there is order even to drinking cold water.
So, when the first officer says, “Don’t you think it rains more? In this
area, here?” we know what he means by that: Captain. You have
committed us to visual approach, with no backup plan, and the weather
outside is terrible. You think that we will break out of the clouds in time

to see the runway. But what if we don’t? It’s pitch-black outside and
pouring rain and the glide scope is down.
But he can’t say that. He hints, and in his mind he’s said as much as
he can to a superior. The first officer will not mention the weather again.
It is just after that moment that the plane, briefly, breaks out of the
clouds, and off in the distance the pilots see lights.
“Is it Guam?” the flight engineer asks. Then, after a pause, he says,
“It’s Guam, Guam.”
The captain chuckles. “Good!”
But it isn’t good. It’s an illusion. They’ve come out of the clouds for a
moment. But they are still twenty miles from the airport, and there is an
enormous amount of bad weather still ahead of them. The flight engineer
knows this, because it is his responsibility to track the weather, so now
he decides to speak up.
“Captain, the weather radar has helped us a lot,” he says.
The weather radar has helped us a lot? A second hint from the flight
deck. What the engineer means is just what the first officer meant. This
isn’t a night where you can rely on just your eyes to land the plane. Look
at what the weather radar is telling us: there’s trouble ahead.
To Western ears, it seems strange that the flight engineer would bring
up this subject just once. Western communication has what linguists call
a “transmitter orientation”—that is, it is considered the responsibility of
the speaker to communicate ideas clearly and unambiguously. Even in
the tragic case of the Air Florida crash, where the first officer never does
more than hint about the danger posed by the ice, he still hints four
times, phrasing his comments four different ways, in an attempt to make
his meaning clear. He may have been constrained by the power distance
between himself and the captain, but he was still operating within a
Western cultural context, which holds that if there is confusion, it is the
fault of the speaker.
But Korea, like many Asian countries, is receiver oriented. It is up to
the listener to make sense of what is being said. In the engineer’s mind,
he has said a lot.
Sohn gives the following conversation as an illustration, an exchange
between an employee (Mr. Kim) and his boss, a division chief
(kwachang).
KWACHANG: It’s cold and I’m kind of hungry.

[MEANING: Why don’t you buy a drink or something to eat?]
MR. KIM: How about having a glass of liquor?
[MEANING: I will buy liquor for you.]
KWACHANG: It’s okay. Don’t bother.
[MEANING: I will accept your offer if you repeat it.]
MR. KIM: You must be hungry. How about going out?
[MEANING: I insist upon treating you.]
KWACHANG: Shall I do so?
[MEANING: I accept.]
There is something beautiful in the subtlety of that exchange, in the
attention that each party must pay to the motivations and desires of the
other. It is civilized, in the truest sense of that word: it does not permit
insensitivity or indifference.
But high–power distance communication works only when the
listener is capable of paying close attention, and it works only if the two
parties in a conversation have the luxury of time, in order to unwind each
other’s meanings. It doesn’t work in an airplane cockpit on a stormy
night with an exhausted pilot trying to land at an airport with a broken
glide scope.
13.
In 2000, Korean Air finally acted, bringing in an outsider from Delta Air
Lines, David Greenberg, to run their flight operations.
Greenberg’s first step was something that would make no sense if you
did not understand the true roots of Korean Air’s problems. He evaluated
the English language skills of all of the airline’s flight crews. “Some of
them were fine and some of them weren’t,” he remembers. “So we set up
a program to assist and improve the proficiency of aviation English.” His
second step was to bring in a Western firm—a subsidiary of Boeing
called Alteon—to take over the company’s training and instruction
programs. “Alteon conducted their training in English,” Greenberg says.
“They didn’t speak Korean.” Greenberg’s rule was simple. The new
language of Korean Air was English, and if you wanted to remain a pilot
at the company, you had to be fluent in that language. “This was not a
purge,” he says. “Everyone had the same opportunity, and those who
found the language issue challenging were allowed to go out and study

on their own nickel. But language was the filter. I can’t recall that
anyone was fired for flying proficiency shortcomings.”
Greenberg’s rationale was that English was the language of the
aviation world. When the pilots sat in the cockpit and worked their way
through the written checklists that flight crews follow on every
significant point of procedure, those checklists were in English. When
they talked to Air Traffic Control anywhere in the world, those
conversations would be in English.
“If you are trying to land at JFK at rush hour, there is no nonverbal
communication,” Greenberg says. “It’s people talking to people, so you
need to be darn sure you understand what’s going on. You can say that
two Koreans side by side don’t need to speak English. But if they are
arguing about what the guys outside said in English, then language is
important.”
Greenberg wanted to give his pilots an alternate identity. Their
problem was that they were trapped in roles dictated by the heavy weight
of their country’s cultural legacy. They needed an opportunity to step
outside those roles when they sat in the cockpit, and language was the
key to that transformation. In English, they would be free of the sharply
defined gradients of Korean hierarchy: formal deference, informal
deference, blunt, familiar, intimate, and plain. Instead, the pilots could
participate in a culture and language with a very different legacy.
The crucial part of Greenberg’s reform, however, is what he didn’t
do. He didn’t throw up his hands in despair. He didn’t fire all of his
Korean pilots and start again with pilots from a low–power distance
culture. He knew that cultural legacies matter—that they are powerful
and pervasive and that they persist, long after their original usefulness
has passed. But he didn’t assume that legacies are an indelible part of
who we are. He believed that if the Koreans were honest about where
they came from and were willing to confront those aspects of their
heritage that did not suit the aviation world, they could change. He
offered his pilots what everyone from hockey players to software
tycoons to takeover lawyers has been offered on the way to success: an
opportunity to transform their relationship to their work.
After leaving Korean Air, Greenberg helped start up a freight airline
called Cargo 360, and he took a number of Korean pilots with him. They
were all flight engineers, who had been number three, after the captain
and first officer, in the strict hierarchy of the original Korean Air. “These

were guys who had performed in the old environment at Korean Air for
as much as fifteen to eighteen years,” he said. “They had accepted that
subservient role. They had been at the bottom of the ladder. We retrained
them and put them with Western crew. They’ve been a great success.
They all changed their style. They take initiative. They pull their share of
the load. They don’t wait for someone to direct them. These are senior
people, in their fifties, with a long history in one context, who have been
retrained and are now successful doing their job in a Western cockpit.
We took them out of their culture and re-normed them.”
That is an extraordinarily liberating example. When we understand
what it really means to be a good pilot—when we understand how much
culture and history and the world outside of the individual matter to
professional success—then we don’t have to throw up our hands in
despair at an airline where pilots crash planes into the sides of
mountains. We have a way to make successes out of the unsuccessful.
But first we have to be frank about a subject that we would all too
often rather ignore. In 1994, when Boeing first published safety data
showing a clear correlation between a country’s plane crashes and its
score on Hofstede’s Dimensions, the company’s researchers practically
tied themselves in knots trying not to cause offense. “We’re not saying
there’s anything here, but we think there’s something there” is how
Boeing’s chief engineer for airplane safety put it. Why are we so
squeamish? Why is the fact that each of us comes from a culture with its
own distinctive mix of strengths and weaknesses, tendencies and
predispositions, so difficult to acknowledge? Who we are cannot be
separated from where we’re from—and when we ignore that fact, planes
crash.
14.
Back to the cockpit.
“Captain, the weather radar has helped us a lot.” No pilot would say
that now. But this was in 1997, before Korean Air took its power
distance issues seriously. The captain was tired, and the engineer’s true
meaning sailed over the captain’s head.
“Yes,” the captain says in response. “They are very useful.” He isn’t
listening.

The plane is flying toward the VOR beacon and the VOR is on the
side of a mountain. The weather hasn’t broken. So the pilots can’t see
anything. The captain puts the landing gear down and extends the flaps.
At 1:41:48, the captain says, “Wiper on,” and the flight engineer turns
the wipers on. It’s raining now.
At 1:41:59, the first officer asks, “Not in sight?” He’s looking for the
runway. He can’t see it. He’s had a sinking feeling in his stomach for
some time now. One second later, the Ground Proximity Warning System
calls out in its toneless electronic voice, “Five hundred [feet].” The plane
is five hundred feet off the ground. The ground in this case is the side of
Nimitz Hill. But the crew is confused because they think that the ground
means the runway, and how can that be if they can’t see the runway? The
flight engineer says, “Eh?” in an astonished tone of voice. You can
imagine them all thinking furiously, trying to square their assumption of
where the plane is with what their instruments are telling them.
At 1:42:19, the first officer says, “Let’s make a missed approach.” He
has finally upgraded from a hint to a crew obligation: he wants to abort
the landing. Later, in the crash investigation, it was determined that if he
had seized control of the plane in that moment, there would have been
enough time to pull up the nose and clear Nimitz Hill. That is what first
officers are trained to do when they believe a captain is clearly in the
wrong. But it is one thing to learn that in a classroom, and quite another
to actually do it in the air, with someone who might rap you with the
back of his hand if you make a mistake.
1:42:20. FLIGHT ENGINEER: Not in sight.
With disaster staring them in the face, both the first officer and the
engineer have finally spoken up. They want the captain to go around, to
pull up and start the landing over again. But it’s too late.
1:42:21. FIRST OFFICER: Not in sight, missed approach.
1:42:22. FLIGHT ENGINEER: Go around.
1:42:23. CAPTAIN: Go around.
1:42:24:05. GROUND PROXIMITY WARNING SYSTEM (GPWS): One
hundred.
1:42:24:84. GPWS: Fifty.
1:42:25:19. GPWS: Forty.

1:42:25:50. GPWS: Thirty.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Rice Paddies and Math Tests
“NO ONE WHO CAN RISE BEFORE DAWN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAYS A
YEAR FAILS TO MAKE HIS FAMILY RICH.”
1.
The gateway to the industrial heartland of Southern China runs up
through the wide, verdant swath of the Pearl River Delta. The land is
covered by a thick, smoggy haze. The freeways are crammed with tractor
trailers. Power lines crisscross the landscape. Factories making cameras,
computers, watches, umbrellas, and T-shirts stand cheek by jowl with
densely packed blocks of apartment buildings and fields of banana and
mango trees, sugarcane, papaya, and pineapple destined for the export
market. Few landscapes in the world have changed so much in so short a
time. A generation ago, the skies would have been clear and the road
would have been a two-lane highway. And a generation before that, all
you would have seen were rice paddies.
Two hours in, at the headwaters of the Pearl River, lies the city of
Guangzhou, and past Guangzhou, remnants of the old China are easier to
find. The countryside becomes breathtakingly beautiful, rolling hills
dotted with outcroppings of limestone rock against the backdrop of the
Nan Ling Mountains. Here and there are the traditional khaki-colored
mud-brick huts of the Chinese peasantry. In the small towns, there are
open-air markets: chickens and geese in elaborate bamboo baskets,
vegetables laid out in rows on the ground, slabs of pork on tables,
tobacco being sold in big clumps. And everywhere, there is rice, miles
upon miles of it. In the winter season, the paddies are dry and dotted with
the stubble of the previous year’s crop. After the crops are planted in
early spring, as the humid winds begin to blow, they turn a magical

green, and by the time of the first harvest, as the grains emerge on the
ends of the rice shoots, the land becomes an unending sea of yellow.
Rice has been cultivated in China for thousands of years. It was from
China that the techniques of rice cultivation spread throughout East Asia
—Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Year in, year out, as far back as
history is recorded, farmers from across Asia have engaged in the same
relentless, intricate pattern of agriculture.
Rice paddies are “built,” not “opened up” the way a wheat field is.
You don’t just clear the trees, underbrush, and stones and then plow. Rice
fields are carved into mountainsides in an elaborate series of terraces, or
painstakingly constructed from marshland and river plains. A rice paddy
has to be irrigated, so a complex system of dikes has to be built around
the field. Channels must be dug from the nearest water source, and gates
built into the dikes so the water flow can be adjusted precisely to cover
the right amount of the plant.
The paddy itself, meanwhile, has to have a hard clay floor; otherwise
the water will simply seep into the ground. But of course, rice seedlings
can’t be planted in hard clay, so on top of the clay, there has to be a thick,
soft layer of mud. And the claypan, as it’s called, has to be carefully
engineered so that it will drain properly and also keep the plants
submerged at the optimum level. Rice has to be fertilized repeatedly,
which is another art. Traditionally, farmers used “night soil” (human
manure) and a combination of burned compost, river mud, bean cake,
and hemp—and they had to be careful, because too much fertilizer, or
the right amount applied at the wrong time, could be as bad as too little.
When the time came to plant, a Chinese farmer would have hundreds
of different varieties of rice from which to choose, each one of which
offered a slightly different trade-off, say, between yield and how quickly
it grew, or how well it did in times of drought, or how it fared in poor
soil. A farmer might plant a dozen or more different varieties at one
time, adjusting the mix from season to season in order to manage the risk
of a crop failure.
He or she (or, more accurately, the whole family, since rice
agriculture was a family affair) would plant the seed in a specially
prepared seedbed. After a few weeks, the seedlings would be
transplanted into the field, in carefully spaced rows six inches apart, and
then painstakingly nurtured.

Weeding was done by hand, diligently and unceasingly, because the
seedlings could easily be choked by other plant life. Sometimes each rice
shoot would be individually groomed with a bamboo comb to clear away
insects. All the while, farmers had to check and recheck water levels and
make sure the water didn’t get too hot in the summer sun. And when the
rice ripened, farmers gathered all of their friends and relatives and, in
one coordinated burst, harvested it as quickly as possible so they could
get a second crop in before the winter dry season began.
Breakfast in South China, at least for those who could afford it, was
congee—white rice porridge, with lettuce and dace paste and bamboo
shoots. Lunch was more congee. Dinner was rice with “toppings.” Rice
was what you sold at the market to buy the other necessities of life. It
was how wealth and status were measured. It dictated almost every
working moment of every day. “Rice is life,” says the anthropologist
Gonçalo Santos, who has studied a traditional South Chinese village.
“Without rice, you don’t survive. If you want to be anyone in this part of
China, you would have to have rice. It made the world go around.”
2.
Take a look at the following list of numbers: 4, 8, 5, 3, 9, 7, 6. Read them
out loud. Now look away and spend twenty seconds memorizing that
sequence before saying them out loud again.
If you speak English, you have about a 50 percent chance of
remembering that sequence perfectly. If you’re Chinese, though, you’re
almost certain to get it right every time. Why is that? Because as human
beings we store digits in a memory loop that runs for about two seconds.
We most easily memorize whatever we can say or read within that two-
second span. And Chinese speakers get that list of numbers—4, 8, 5, 3,
9, 7, 6—right almost every time because, unlike English, their language
allows them to fit all those seven numbers into two seconds.
That example comes from Stanislas Dehaene’s book The Number
Sense. As Dehaene explains:
Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be
uttered in less than one-quarter of a second (for instance, 4 is “si”
and 7 “qi”). Their English equivalents—“four,” “seven”—are
longer: pronouncing them takes about one-third of a second. The

memory gap between English and Chinese apparently is entirely
due to this difference in length. In languages as diverse as Welsh,
Arabic, Chinese, English and Hebrew, there is a reproducible
correlation between the time required to pronounce numbers in a
given language and the memory span of its speakers. In this
domain, the prize for efficacy goes to the Cantonese dialect of
Chinese, whose brevity grants residents of Hong Kong a rocketing
memory span of about 10 digits.
It turns out that there is also a big difference in how number-naming
systems in Western and Asian languages are constructed. In English, we
say fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen, so one might
expect that we would also say oneteen, twoteen, threeteen, and fiveteen.
But we don’t. We use a different form: eleven, twelve, thirteen, and
fifteen. Similarly, we have forty and sixty, which sound like the words
they are related to (four and six). But we also say fifty and thirty and
twenty, which sort of sound like five and three and two, but not really.
And, for that matter, for numbers above twenty, we put the “decade” first
and the unit number second (twenty-one, twenty-two), whereas for the
teens, we do it the other way around (fourteen, seventeen, eighteen). The
number system in English is highly irregular. Not so in China, Japan, and
Korea. They have a logical counting system. Eleven is ten-one. Twelve is
ten-two. Twenty-four is two-tens-four and so on.
That difference means that Asian children learn to count much faster
than American children. Four-year-old Chinese children can count, on
average, to forty. American children at that age can count only to fifteen,
and most don’t reach forty until they’re five. By the age of five, in other
words, American children are already a year behind their Asian
counterparts in the most fundamental of math skills.
The regularity of their number system also means that Asian children
can perform basic functions, such as addition, far more easily. Ask an
English-speaking seven-year-old to add thirty-seven plus twenty-two in
her head, and she has to convert the words to numbers (37 + 22). Only
then can she do the math: 2 plus 7 is 9 and 30 and 20 is 50, which makes
59. Ask an Asian child to add three-tens-seven and two-tens-two, and
then the necessary equation is right there, embedded in the sentence. No
number translation is necessary: It’s five-tens-nine.

“The Asian system is transparent,” says Karen Fuson, a Northwestern
University psychologist who has closely studied Asian-Western
differences. “I think that it makes the whole attitude toward math
different. Instead of being a rote learning thing, there’s a pattern I can
figure out. There is an expectation that I can do this. There is an
expectation that it’s sensible. For fractions, we say three-fifths. The
Chinese is literally ‘out of five parts, take three.’ That’s telling you
conceptually what a fraction is. It’s differentiating the denominator and
the numerator.”
The much-storied disenchantment with mathematics among Western
children starts in the third and fourth grades, and Fuson argues that
perhaps a part of that disenchantment is due to the fact that math doesn’t
seem to make sense; its linguistic structure is clumsy; its basic rules
seem arbitrary and complicated.
Asian children, by contrast, don’t feel nearly that same bafflement.
They can hold more numbers in their heads and do calculations faster,
and the way fractions are expressed in their languages corresponds
exactly to the way a fraction actually is—and maybe that makes them a
little more likely to enjoy math, and maybe because they enjoy math a
little more, they try a little harder and take more math classes and are
more willing to do their homework, and on and on, in a kind of virtuous
circle.
When it comes to math, in other words, Asians have a built-in
advantage. But it’s an unusual kind of advantage. For years, students
from China, South Korea, and Japan—and the children of recent
immigrants who are from those countries—have substantially
outperformed their Western counterparts at mathematics, and the typical
assumption is that it has something to do with a kind of innate Asian
proclivity for math.* The psychologist Richard Lynn has even gone so
far as to propose an elaborate evolutionary theory involving the
Himalayas, really cold weather, premodern hunting practices, brain size,
and specialized vowel sounds to explain why Asians have higher IQs.†
That’s how we think about math. We assume that being good at things
like calculus and algebra is a simple function of how smart someone is.
But the differences between the number systems in the East and the West
suggest something very different—that being good at math may also be
rooted in a group’s culture.

In the case of the Koreans, one kind of deeply rooted legacy stood in
the way of the very modern task of flying an airplane. Here we have
another kind of legacy, one that turns out to be perfectly suited for
twenty-first-century tasks. Cultural legacies matter, and once we’ve seen
the surprising effects of such things as power distance and numbers that
can be said in a quarter as opposed to a third of a second, it’s hard not to
wonder how many other cultural legacies have an impact on our twenty-
first-century intellectual tasks. What if coming from a culture shaped by
the demands of growing rice also makes you better at math? Could the
rice paddy make a difference in the classroom?
3.
The most striking fact about a rice paddy—which can never quite be
grasped until you actually stand in the middle of one—is its size. It’s
tiny. The typical rice paddy is about as big as a hotel room. A typical
Asian rice farm might be composed of two or three paddies. A village in
China of fifteen hundred people might support itself entirely with 450
acres of land, which in the American Midwest would be the size of a
typical family farm. At that scale, with families of five and six people
living off a farm the size of two hotel rooms, agriculture changes
dramatically.
Historically, Western agriculture is “mechanically” oriented. In the
West, if a farmer wanted to become more efficient or increase his yield,
he introduced more and more sophisticated equipment, which allowed
him to replace human labor with mechanical labor: a threshing machine,
a hay baler, a combine harvester, a tractor. He cleared another field and
increased his acreage, because now his machinery allowed him to work
more land with the same amount of effort. But in Japan or China,
farmers didn’t have the money to buy equipment—and, in any case,
there certainly wasn’t any extra land that could easily be converted into
new fields. So rice farmers improved their yields by becoming smarter,
by being better managers of their own time, and by making better
choices. As the anthropologist Francesca Bray puts it, rice agriculture is
“skill oriented”: if you’re willing to weed a bit more diligently, and
become more adept at fertilizing, and spend a bit more time monitoring
water levels, and do a better job keeping the claypan absolutely level,
and make use of every square inch of your rice paddy, you’ll harvest a

bigger crop. Throughout history, not surprisingly, the people who grow
rice have always worked harder than almost any other kind of farmer.
That last statement may seem a little odd, because most of us have a
sense that everyone in the premodern world worked really hard. But that
simply isn’t true. All of us, for example, are descended at some point
from hunter-gatherers, and many hunter-gatherers, by all accounts, had a
pretty leisurely life. The !Kung bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, in
Botswana, who are one of the last remaining practitioners of that way of
life, subsist on a rich assortment of fruits, berries, roots, and nuts—in
particular the mongongo nut, an incredibly plentiful and protein-rich
source of food that lies thick on the ground. They don’t grow anything,
and it is growing things—preparing, planting, weeding, harvesting,
storing—that takes time. Nor do they raise any animals. Occasionally,
the male !Kung hunt, but chiefly for sport. All told, !Kung men and
women work no more than about twelve to nineteen hours a week, with
the balance of the time spent dancing, entertaining, and visiting family
and friends. That’s, at most, one thousand hours of work a year. (When a
bushman was asked once why his people hadn’t taken to agriculture, he
looked puzzled and said, “Why should we plant, when there are so many
mongongo nuts in the world?”)
Or consider the life of a peasant in eighteenth-century Europe. Men
and women in those days probably worked from dawn to noon two
hundred days a year, which works out to about twelve hundred hours of
work annually. During harvest or spring planting, the day might be
longer. In the winter, much less. In The Discovery of France, the
historian Graham Robb argues that peasant life in a country like France,
even well into the nineteenth century, was essentially brief episodes of
work followed by long periods of idleness.
“Ninety-nine percent of all human activity described in this and other
accounts [of French country life],” he writes, “took place between late
spring and early autumn.” In the Pyrenees and the Alps, entire villages
would essentially hibernate from the time of the first snow in November
until March or April. In more temperate regions of France, where
temperatures in the winter rarely fell below freezing, the same pattern
held. Robb continues:
The fields of Flanders were deserted for much of the year. An
official report on the Nièvre in 1844 described the strange

mutation of the Burgundian day-laborer once the harvest was in
and the vine stocks had been burned: “After making the necessary
repairs to their tools, these vigorous men will now spend their
days in bed, packing their bodies tightly together in order to stay
warm and eat less food. They weaken themselves deliberately.”
Human hibernation was a physical and economic necessity.
Lowering the metabolic rate prevented hunger from exhausting
supplies…. People trudged and dawdled, even in summer…. After
the revolution, in Alsace and the Pas-de-Calais, officials
complained that wine growers and independent farmers, instead of
undertaking “some peaceful and sedentary industry” in the quieter
season, “abandon themselves to dumb idleness.”
If you were a peasant farmer in Southern China, by contrast, you
didn’t sleep through the winter. In the short break marked by the dry
season, from November through February, you busied yourself with side
tasks. You made bamboo baskets or hats and sold them in the market.
You repaired the dikes in your rice paddy, and rebuilt your mud hut. You
sent one of your sons to work in a nearby village for a relative. You
made tofu and dried bean curd and caught snakes (they were a delicacy)
and trapped insects. By the time lahp cheun (the “turning of the spring”)
came, you were back in the fields at dawn. Working in a rice field is ten
to twenty times more labor-intensive than working on an equivalent-size
corn or wheat field. Some estimates put the annual workload of a wet-
rice farmer in Asia at three thousand hours a year.
4.
Think, for a moment, about what the life of a rice farmer in the Pearl
River Delta must have been like. Three thousand hours a year is a
staggering amount of time to spend working, particularly if many of
those hours involve being bent over in the hot sun, planting and weeding
in a rice paddy.
What redeemed the life of a rice farmer, however, was the nature of
that work. It was a lot like the garment work done by the Jewish
immigrants to New York. It was meaningful. First of all, there is a clear
relationship in rice farming between effort and reward. The harder you
work a rice field, the more it yields. Second, it’s complex work. The rice

farmer isn’t simply planting in the spring and harvesting in the fall. He or
she effectively runs a small business, juggling a family workforce,
hedging uncertainty through seed selection, building and managing a
sophisticated irrigation system, and coordinating the complicated process
of harvesting the first crop while simultaneously preparing the second
crop.
And, most of all, it’s autonomous. The peasants of Europe worked
essentially as low-paid slaves of an aristocratic landlord, with little
control over their own destinies. But China and Japan never developed
that kind of oppressive feudal system, because feudalism simply can’t
work in a rice economy. Growing rice is too complicated and intricate
for a system that requires farmers to be coerced and bullied into going
out into the fields each morning. By the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, landlords in central and Southern China had an almost
completely hands-off relationship with their tenants: they would collect a
fixed rent and let farmers go about their business.
“The thing about wet-rice farming is, not only do you need
phenomenal amounts of labor, but it’s very exacting,” says the historian
Kenneth Pomerantz. “You have to care. It really matters that the field is
perfectly leveled before you flood it. Getting it close to level but not
quite right makes a big difference in terms of your yield. It really matters
that the water is in the fields for just the right amount of time. There’s a
big difference between lining up the seedlings at exactly the right
distance and doing it sloppily. It’s not like you put the corn in the ground
in mid-March and as long as rain comes by the end of the month, you’re
okay. You’re controlling all the inputs in a very direct way. And when
you have something that requires that much care, the overlord has to
have a system that gives the actual laborer some set of incentives, where
if the harvest comes out well, the farmer gets a bigger share. That’s why
you get fixed rents, where the landlord says, I get twenty bushels,
regardless of the harvest, and if it’s really good, you get the extra. It’s a
crop that doesn’t do very well with something like slavery or wage labor.
It would just be too easy to leave the gate that controls the irrigation
water open a few seconds too long and there goes your field.”
The historian David Arkush once compared Russian and Chinese
peasant proverbs, and the differences are striking. “If God does not bring
it, the earth will not give it” is a typical Russian proverb. That’s the kind
of fatalism and pessimism typical of a repressive feudal system, where

peasants have no reason to believe in the efficacy of their own work. On
the other hand, Arkush writes, Chinese proverbs are striking in their
belief that “hard work, shrewd planning and self-reliance or cooperation
with a small group will in time bring recompense.”
Here are some of the things that penniless peasants would say to one
another as they worked three thousand hours a year in the baking heat
and humidity of Chinese rice paddies (which, by the way, are filled with
leeches):
“No food without blood and sweat.”
“Farmers are busy; farmers are busy; if farmers weren’t busy, where
would grain to get through the winter come from?”
“In winter, the lazy man freezes to death.”
“Don’t depend on heaven for food, but on your own two hands
carrying the load.”
“Useless to ask about the crops, it all depends on hard work and
fertilizer.”
“If a man works hard, the land will not be lazy.”
And, most telling of all: “No one who can rise before dawn three
hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.” Rise before
dawn? 360 days a year? For the !Kung leisurely gathering mongongo
nuts, or the French peasant sleeping away the winter, or anyone else
living in something other than the world of rice cultivation, that proverb
would be unthinkable.
This is not, of course, an unfamiliar observation about Asian culture.
Go to any Western college campus and you’ll find that Asian students
have a reputation for being in the library long after everyone else has
left. Sometimes people of Asian background get offended when their
culture is described this way, because they think that the stereotype is
being used as a form of disparagement. But a belief in work ought to be a
thing of beauty. Virtually every success story we’ve seen in this book so
far involves someone or some group working harder than their peers. Bill
Gates was addicted to his computer as a child. So was Bill Joy. The
Beatles put in thousands of hours of practice in Hamburg. Joe Flom
ground away for years, perfecting the art of takeovers, before he got his
chance. Working really hard is what successful people do, and the genius
of the culture formed in the rice paddies is that hard work gave those in

the fields a way to find meaning in the midst of great uncertainty and
poverty. That lesson has served Asians well in many endeavors but rarely
so perfectly as in the case of mathematics.

A few years ago, Alan Schoenfeld, a math professor at Berkeley, made a
videotape of a woman named Renee as she was trying to solve a math
problem. Renee was in her mid-twenties, with long black hair and round
silver glasses. In the tape, she’s playing with a software program
designed to teach algebra. On the screen are a y and an x axis. The
program asks the user to punch in a set of coordinates and then draws the
line from those coordinates on the screen. For example, when she typed
in 5 on the y axis and 5 on the x axis, the computer did this:
At this point, I’m sure, some vague memory of your middle-school
algebra is coming back to you. But rest assured, you don’t need to
remember any of it to understand the significance of Renee’s example. In
fact, as you listen to Renee talking in the next few paragraphs, focus not
on what she’s saying but rather on how she’s talking and why she’s
talking the way she is.
The point of the computer program, which Schoenfeld created, was to
teach students about how to calculate the slope of a line. Slope, as I’m
sure you remember (or, more accurately, as I’ll bet you don’t remember;
I certainly didn’t), is rise over run. The slope of the line in our example
is 1, since the rise is 5 and the run is 5.
So there is Renee. She’s sitting at the keyboard, and she’s trying to
figure out what numbers to enter in order to get the computer to draw a

line that is absolutely vertical, that is directly superimposed over the y
axis. Now, those of you who remember your high school math will know
that this is, in fact, impossible. A vertical line has an undefined slope. Its
rise is infinite: any number on the y axis starting at zero and going on
forever. It’s run on the x axis, meanwhile, is zero. Infinity divided by
zero is not a number.
But Renee doesn’t realize that what she’s trying to do can’t be done.
She is, rather, in the grip of what Schoenfeld calls a “glorious
misconception,” and the reason Schoenfeld likes to show this particular
tape is that it is a perfect demonstration of how this misconception came
to be resolved.
Renee was a nurse. She wasn’t someone who had been particularly
interested in mathematics in the past. But she had somehow gotten hold
of the software and was hooked.
“Now, what I want to do is make a straight line with this formula,
parallel to the y axis,” she begins. Schoenfeld is sitting next to her. She
looks over at him anxiously. “It’s been five years since I did any of this.”
She starts to fiddle with the program, typing in different numbers.
“Now if I change the slope that way… minus 1… now what I mean to
do is make the line go straight.”
As she types in numbers, the line on the screen changes.
“Oops. That’s not going to do it.”
She looks puzzled.
“What are you trying to do?” Schoenfeld asks.
“What I’m trying to do is make a straight line parallel to the y axis.
What do I need to do here? I think what I need to do is change this a little
bit.” She points at the place where the number for the y axis is. “That
was something I discovered. That when you go from 1 to 2, there was a
rather big change. But now if you get way up there you have to keep
changing.”
This is Renee’s glorious misconception. She’s noticed the higher she
makes the y axis coordinate, the steeper the line gets. So she thinks the
key to making a vertical line is just making the y axis coordinate large
enough.
“I guess 12 or even 13 could do it. Maybe even as much as 15.”
She frowns. She and Schoenfeld go back and forth. She asks him
questions. He prods her gently in the right direction. She keeps trying
and trying, one approach after another.

At one point, she types in 20. The line gets a little bit steeper.
She types in 40. The line gets steeper still.
“I see that there is a relationship there. But as to why, it doesn’t seem
to make sense to me…. What if I do 80? If 40 gets me halfway, then 80
should get me all the way to the y axis. So let’s just see what happens.”
She types in 80. The line is steeper. But it’s still not totally vertical.
“Ohhh. It’s infinity, isn’t it? It’s never going to get there.” Renee is
close. But then she reverts to her original misconception.
“So what do I need? 100? Every time you double the number, you get
halfway to the y axis. But it never gets there…”
She types in 100.

“It’s closer. But not quite there yet.”
She starts to think out loud. It’s obvious she’s on the verge of figuring
something out. “Well, I knew this, though… but… I knew that. For each
one up, it goes that many over. I’m still somewhat confused as to
why…”
She pauses, squinting at the screen.
“I’m getting confused. It’s a tenth of the way to the one. But I don’t
want it to be…”
And then she sees it.
“Oh! It’s any number up, and zero over. It’s any number divided by
zero!” Her face lights up. “A vertical line is anything divided by zero—
and that’s an undefined number. Ohhh. Okay. Now I see. The slope of a
vertical line is undefined. Ahhhh. That means something now. I won’t
forget that!”
6.
Over the course of his career, Schoenfeld has videotaped countless
students as they worked on math problems. But the Renee tape is one of
his favorites because of how beautifully it illustrates what he considers to
be the secret to learning mathematics. Twenty-two minutes pass from the
moment Renee begins playing with the computer program to the moment
she says, “Ahhhh. That means something now.” That’s a long time. “This
is eighth-grade mathematics,” Schoenfeld said. “If I put the average
eighth grader in the same position as Renee, I’m guessing that after the
first few attempts, they would have said, ‘I don’t get it. I need you to
explain it.’ ” Schoenfeld once asked a group of high school students how

long they would work on a homework question before they concluded it
was too hard for them ever to solve. Their answers ranged from thirty
seconds to five minutes, with the average answer two minutes.
But Renee persists. She experiments. She goes back over the same
issues time and again. She thinks out loud. She keeps going and going.
She simply won’t give up. She knows on some vague level that there is
something wrong with her theory about how to draw a vertical line, and
she won’t stop until she’s absolutely sure she has it right.
Renee wasn’t a math natural. Abstract concepts like “slope” and
“undefined” clearly didn’t come easily to her. But Schoenfeld could not
have found her more impressive.
“There’s a will to make sense that drives what she does,” Schoenfeld
says. “She wouldn’t accept a superficial ‘Yeah, you’re right’ and walk
away. That’s not who she is. And that’s really unusual.” He rewound the
tape and pointed to a moment when Renee reacted with genuine surprise
to something on the screen.
“Look,” he said. “She does a double take. Many students would just
let that fly by. Instead, she thought, ‘That doesn’t jibe with whatever I’m
thinking. I don’t get it. That’s important. I want an explanation.’ And
when she finally gets the explanation, she says, ‘Yeah, that fits.’ ”
At Berkeley, Schoenfeld teaches a course on problem solving, the
entire point of which, he says, is to get his students to unlearn the
mathematical habits they picked up on the way to university. “I pick a
problem that I don’t know how to solve,” he says. “I tell my students,
‘You’re going to have a two-week take-home exam. I know your habits.
You’re going to do nothing for the first week and start it next week, and I
want to warn you now: If you only spend one week on this, you’re not
going to solve it. If, on the other hand, you start working the day I give
you the midterm, you’ll be frustrated. You’ll come to me and say, ‘It’s
impossible.’ I’ll tell you, Keep working, and by week two, you’ll find
you’ll make significant progress.”
We sometimes think of being good at mathematics as an innate
ability. You either have “it” or you don’t. But to Schoenfeld, it’s not so
much ability as attitude. You master mathematics if you are willing to
try. That’s what Schoenfeld attempts to teach his students. Success is a
function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard
for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people
would give up on after thirty seconds. Put a bunch of Renees in a

classroom, and give them the space and time to explore mathematics for
themselves, and you could go a long way. Or imagine a country where
Renee’s doggedness is not the exception, but a cultural trait, embedded
as deeply as the culture of honor in the Cumberland Plateau. Now that
would be a country good at math.
7.
Every four years, an international group of educators administers a
comprehensive mathematics and science test to elementary and junior
high students around the world. It’s the TIMSS (the same test you read
about earlier, in the discussion of differences between fourth graders
born near the beginning of a school cutoff date and those born near the
end of the date), and the point of the TIMSS is to compare the
educational achievement of one country with another’s.
When students sit down to take the TIMSS exam, they also have to
fill out a questionnaire. It asks them all kinds of things, such as what
their parents’ level of education is, and what their views about math are,
and what their friends are like. It’s not a trivial exercise. It’s about 120
questions long. In fact, it is so tedious and demanding that many students
leave as many as ten or twenty questions blank.
Now, here’s the interesting part. As it turns out, the average number
of items answered on that questionnaire varies from country to country.
It is possible, in fact, to rank all the participating countries according to
how many items their students answer on the questionnaire. Now, what
do you think happens if you compare the questionnaire rankings with the
math rankings on the TIMSS? They are exactly the same. In other words,
countries whose students are willing to concentrate and sit still long
enough and focus on answering every single question in an endless
questionnaire are the same countries whose students do the best job of
solving math problems.
The person who discovered this fact is an educational researcher at
the University of Pennsylvania named Erling Boe, and he stumbled
across it by accident. “It came out of the blue,” he says. Boe hasn’t even
been able to publish his findings in a scientific journal, because, he says,
it’s just a bit too weird. Remember, he’s not saying that the ability to
finish the questionnaire and the ability to excel on the math test are

related. He’s saying that they are the same: if you compare the two
rankings, they are identical.
Think about this another way. Imagine that every year, there was a
Math Olympics in some fabulous city in the world. And every country in
the world sent its own team of one thousand eighth graders. Boe’s point
is that we could predict precisely the order in which every country would
finish in the Math Olympics without asking a single math question. All
we would have to do is give them some task measuring how hard they
were willing to work. In fact, we wouldn’t even have to give them a task.
We should be able to predict which countries are best at math simply by
looking at which national cultures place the highest emphasis on effort
and hard work.
So, which places are at the top of both lists? The answer shouldn’t
surprise you: Singapore, South Korea, China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, and
Japan. What those five have in common, of course, is that they are all
cultures shaped by the tradition of wet-rice agriculture and meaningful
work.* They are the kinds of places where, for hundreds of years,
penniless peasants, slaving away in the rice paddies three thousand hours
a year, said things to one another like “No one who can rise before dawn
three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.”†

CHAPTER NINE
Marita’s Bargain
“ALL MY FRIENDS NOW ARE FROM KIPP.”
1.
In the mid-1990s, an experimental public school called the KIPP
Academy opened on the fourth floor of Lou Gehrig Junior High School
in New York City.* Lou Gehrig is in the seventh school district,
otherwise known as the South Bronx, one of the poorest neighborhoods
in New York City. It is a squat, gray 1960s-era building across the street
from a bleak-looking group of high-rises. A few blocks over is Grand
Concourse, the borough’s main thoroughfare. These are not streets that
you’d happily walk down, alone, after dark.
KIPP is a middle school. Classes are large: the fifth grade has two
sections of thirty-five students each. There are no entrance exams or
admissions requirements. Students are chosen by lottery, with any fourth
grader living in the Bronx eligible to apply. Roughly half of the students
are African American; the rest are Hispanic. Three-quarters of the
children come from single-parent homes. Ninety percent qualify for “free
or reduced lunch,” which is to say that their families earn so little that the
federal government chips in so the children can eat properly at
lunchtime.
KIPP Academy seems like the kind of school in the kind of
neighborhood with the kind of student that would make educators
despair—except that the minute you enter the building, it’s clear that
something is different. The students walk quietly down the hallways in
single file. In the classroom, they are taught to turn and address anyone
talking to them in a protocol known as “SSLANT”: smile, sit up, listen,
ask questions, nod when being spoken to, and track with your eyes. On
the walls of the school’s corridors are hundreds of pennants from the

colleges that KIPP graduates have gone on to attend. Last year, hundreds
of families from across the Bronx entered the lottery for KIPP’s two
fifth-grade classes. It is no exaggeration to say that just over ten years
into its existence, KIPP has become one of the most desirable public
schools in New York City.
What KIPP is most famous for is mathematics. In the South Bronx,
only about 16 percent of all middle school students are performing at or
above their grade level in math. But at KIPP, by the end of fifth grade,
many of the students call math their favorite subject. In seventh grade,
KIPP students start high school algebra. By the end of eighth grade, 84
percent of the students are performing at or above their grade level,
which is to say that this motley group of randomly chosen lower-income
kids from dingy apartments in one of the country’s worst neighborhoods
—whose parents, in an overwhelming number of cases, never set foot in
a college—do as well in mathematics as the privileged eighth graders of
America’s wealthy suburbs. “Our kids’ reading is on point,” said David
Levin, who founded KIPP with a fellow teacher, Michael Feinberg, in
1994. “They struggle a little bit with writing skills. But when they leave
here, they rock in math.”
There are now more than fifty KIPP schools across the United States,
with more on the way. The KIPP program represents one of the most
promising new educational philosophies in the United States. But its
success is best understood not in terms of its curriculum, its teachers, its
resources, or some kind of institutional innovation. KIPP is, rather, an
organization that has succeeded by taking the idea of cultural legacies
seriously.
2.
In the early nineteenth century, a group of reformers set out to establish a
system of public education in the United States. What passed for public
school at the time was a haphazard assortment of locally run one-room
schoolhouses and overcrowded urban classrooms scattered around the
country. In rural areas, schools closed in the spring and fall and ran all
summer long, so that children could help out in the busy planting and
harvesting seasons. In the city, many schools mirrored the long and
chaotic schedules of the children’s working-class parents. The reformers
wanted to make sure that all children went to school and that public

school was comprehensive, meaning that all children got enough
schooling to learn how to read and write and do basic arithmetic and
function as productive citizens.
But as the historian Kenneth Gold has pointed out, the early
educational reformers were also tremendously concerned that children
not get too much schooling. In 1871, for example, the US commissioner
of education published a report by Edward Jarvis on the “Relation of
Education to Insanity.” Jarvis had studied 1,741 cases of insanity and
concluded that “over-study” was responsible for 205 of them. “Education
lays the foundation of a large portion of the causes of mental disorder,”
Jarvis wrote. Similarly, the pioneer of public education in Massachusetts,
Horace Mann, believed that working students too hard would create a
“most pernicious influence upon character and habits…. Not
infrequently is health itself destroyed by over-stimulating the mind.” In
the education journals of the day, there were constant worries about
overtaxing students or blunting their natural abilities through too much
schoolwork.
The reformers, Gold writes:
strove for ways to reduce time spent studying, because long
periods of respite could save the mind from injury. Hence the
elimination of Saturday classes, the shortening of the school day,
and the lengthening of vacation—all of which occurred over the
course of the nineteenth century. Teachers were cautioned that
“when [students] are required to study, their bodies should not be
exhausted by long confinement, nor their minds bewildered by
prolonged application.” Rest also presented particular
opportunities for strengthening cognitive and analytical skills. As
one contributor to the Massachusetts Teacher suggested, “it is
when thus relieved from the state of tension belonging to actual
study that boys and girls, as well as men and women, acquire the
habit of thought and reflection, and of forming their own
conclusions, independently of what they are taught and the
authority of others.”
This idea—that effort must be balanced by rest—could not be more
different from Asian notions about study and work, of course. But then

again, the Asian worldview was shaped by the rice paddy. In the Pearl
River Delta, the rice farmer planted two and sometimes three crops a
year. The land was fallow only briefly. In fact, one of the singular
features of rice cultivation is that because of the nutrients carried by the
water used in irrigation, the more a plot of land is cultivated, the more
fertile it gets.
But in Western agriculture, the opposite is true. Unless a wheat- or
cornfield is left fallow every few years, the soil becomes exhausted.
Every winter, fields are empty. The hard labor of spring planting and fall
harvesting is followed, like clockwork, by the slower pace of summer
and winter. This is the logic the reformers applied to the cultivation of
young minds. We formulate new ideas by analogy, working from what
we know toward what we don’t know, and what the reformers knew were
the rhythms of the agricultural seasons. A mind must be cultivated. But
not too much, lest it be exhausted. And what was the remedy for the
dangers of exhaustion? The long summer vacation—a peculiar and
distinctive American legacy that has had profound consequences for the
learning patterns of the students of the present day.
3.
Summer vacation is a topic seldom mentioned in American educational
debates. It is considered a permanent and inviolate feature of school life,
like high school football or the senior prom. But take a look at the
following sets of elementary school test-score results, and see if your
faith in the value of long summer holidays isn’t profoundly shaken.
These numbers come from research led by the Johns Hopkins
University sociologist Karl Alexander. Alexander tracked the progress of
650 first graders from the Baltimore public school system, looking at
how they scored on a widely used math- and reading-skills exam called
the California Achievement Test. These are reading scores for the first
five years of elementary school, broken down by socioeconomic class—
low, middle, and high.
Class 1st Grade 2nd Grade 3rd Grade 4th Grade 5th Grade
Low 329 375 397 433 461
Middle 348 388 425 467 497
High 361 418 460 506 534

Look at the first column. The students start in first grade with
meaningful, but not overwhelming, differences in their knowledge and
ability. The first graders from the wealthiest homes have a 32-point
advantage over the first graders from the poorest homes—and by the
way, first graders from poor homes in Baltimore are really poor. Now
look at the fifth-grade column. By that point, four years later, the initially
modest gap between rich and poor has more than doubled.
This “achievement gap” is a phenomenon that has been observed over
and over again, and it typically provokes one of two responses. The first
response is that disadvantaged kids simply don’t have the same inherent
ability to learn as children from more privileged backgrounds. They’re
not as smart. The second, slightly more optimistic conclusion is that, in
some way, our schools are failing poor children: we simply aren’t doing
a good enough job of teaching them the skills they need. But here’s
where Alexander’s study gets interesting, because it turns out that neither
of those explanations rings true.
The city of Baltimore didn’t give its kids the California Achievement
Test just at the end of every school year, in June. It gave them the test in
September too, just after summer vacation ended. What Alexander
realized is that the second set of test results allowed him to do a slightly
different analysis. If he looked at the difference between the score a
student got at the beginning of the school year, in September, and the
score he or she got the following June, he could measure—precisely—
how much that student learned over the school year. And if he looked at
the difference between a student’s score in June and then in the following
September, he could see how much that student learned over the course
of the summer. In other words, he could figure out—at least in part—
how much of the achievement gap is the result of things that happen
during the school year, and how much it has to do with what happens
during summer vacation.
Let’s start with the school-year gains. This table shows how many
points students’ test scores rose from the time they started classes in
September to the time they stopped in June. The “Total” column
represents their cumulative classroom learning from all five years of
elementary school.
Class 1st Grade2nd Grade3rd Grade4th Grade5th GradeTotal
Low 55 46 30 33 25 189
Middle 69 43 34 41 27 214

High 60 39 34 28 23 184
Here is a completely different story from the one suggested by the
first table. The first set of test results made it look like lower-income kids
were somehow failing in the classroom. But here we see plainly that isn’t
true. Look at the “Total” column. Over the course of five years of
elementary school, poor kids “out-learn” the wealthiest kids 189 points
to 184 points. They lag behind the middle-class kids by only a modest
amount, and, in fact, in one year, second grade, they learn more than the
middle- or upper-class kids.
Next, let’s see what happens if we look just at how reading scores
change during summer vacation.
Class After 1st After 2nd After 3rd After 4th Total
Low –3.67 –1.70 2.74 2.89 0.26
Middle –3.11 4.18 3.68 2.34 7.09
High 15.38 9.22 14.51 13.38 52.49
Do you see the difference? Look at the first column, which measures
what happens over the summer after first grade. The wealthiest kids
come back in September and their reading scores have jumped more than
15 points. The poorest kids come back from the holidays and their
reading scores have dropped almost 4 points. Poor kids may out-learn
rich kids during the school year. But during the summer, they fall far
behind.
Now take a look at the last column, which totals up all the summer
gains from first grade to fifth grade. The reading scores of the poor kids
go up by .26 points. When it comes to reading skills, poor kids learn
nothing when school is not in session. The reading scores of the rich
kids, by contrast, go up by a whopping 52.49 points. Virtually all of the
advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is the result of
differences in the way privileged kids learn while they are not in school.
What are we seeing here? One very real possibility is that these are
the educational consequences of the differences in parenting styles that
we talked about in the Chris Langan chapter. Think back to Alex
Williams, the nine-year-old whom Annette Lareau studied. His parents
believe in concerted cultivation. He gets taken to museums and gets
enrolled in special programs and goes to summer camp, where he takes
classes. When he’s bored at home, there are plenty of books to read, and
his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively engaged in

the world around him. It’s not hard to see how Alex would get better at
reading and math over the summer.
But not Katie Brindle, the little girl from the other side of the tracks.
There’s no money to send her to summer camp. She’s not getting driven
by her mom to special classes, and there aren’t books lying around her
house that she can read if she gets bored. There’s probably just a
television. She may still have a wonderful vacation, making new friends,
playing outside, going to the movies, having the kind of carefree summer
days that we all dream about. None of those things, though, will improve
her math and reading skills, and every carefree summer day she spends
puts her further and further behind Alex. Alex isn’t necessarily smarter
than Katie. He’s just out-learning her: he’s putting in a few solid months
of learning during the summer while she watches television and plays
outside.
What Alexander’s work suggests is that the way in which education
has been discussed in the United States is backwards. An enormous
amount of time is spent talking about reducing class size, rewriting
curricula, buying every student a shiny new laptop, and increasing school
funding—all of which assumes that there is something fundamentally
wrong with the job schools are doing. But look back at the second table,
which shows what happens between September and June. Schools work.
The only problem with school, for the kids who aren’t achieving, is that
there isn’t enough of it.
Alexander, in fact, has done a very simple calculation to demonstrate
what would happen if the children of Baltimore went to school year-
round. The answer is that poor kids and wealthy kids would, by the end
of elementary school, be doing math and reading at almost the same
level.
Suddenly the causes of Asian math superiority become even more
obvious. Students in Asian schools don’t have long summer vacations.
Why would they? Cultures that believe that the route to success lies in
rising before dawn 360 days a year are scarcely going to give their
children three straight months off in the summer. The school year in the
United States is, on average, 180 days long. The South Korean school
year is 220 days long. The Japanese school year is 243 days long.
One of the questions asked of test takers on a recent math test given
to students around the world was how many of the algebra, calculus, and
geometry questions covered subject matter that they had previously

learned in class. For Japanese twelfth graders, the answer was 92
percent. That’s the value of going to school 243 days a year. You have
the time to learn everything that needs to be learned—and you have less
time to unlearn it. For American twelfth graders, the comparable figure
was 54 percent. For its poorest students, America doesn’t have a school
problem. It has a summer vacation problem, and that’s the problem the
KIPP schools set out to solve. They decided to bring the lessons of the
rice paddy to the American inner city.

“They start school at seven twenty-five,” says David Levin of the
students at the Bronx KIPP Academy. “They all do a course called
thinking skills until seven fifty-five. They do ninety minutes of English,
ninety minutes of math every day, except in fifth grade, where they do
two hours of math a day. An hour of science, an hour of social science,
an hour of music at least twice a week, and then you have an hour and
fifteen minutes of orchestra on top of that. Everyone does orchestra. The
day goes from seven twenty-five until five p.m. After five, there are
homework clubs, detention, sports teams. There are kids here from seven
twenty-five until seven p.m. If you take an average day, and you take out
lunch and recess, our kids are spending fifty to sixty percent more time
learning than the traditional public school student.”
Levin was standing in the school’s main hallway. It was lunchtime
and the students were trooping by quietly in orderly lines, all of them in
their KIPP Academy shirts. Levin stopped a girl whose shirttail was out.
“Do me a favor, when you get a chance,” he called out, miming a
tucking-in movement. He continued: “Saturdays they come in nine to
one. In the summer, it’s eight to two.” By summer, Levin was referring to
the fact that KIPP students do three extra weeks of school, in July. These
are, after all, precisely the kind of lower-income kids who Alexander
identified as losing ground over the long summer vacation, so KIPP’s
response is simply to not have a long summer vacation.
“The beginning is hard,” he went on. “By the end of the day they’re
restless. Part of it is endurance, part of it is motivation. Part of it is
incentives and rewards and fun stuff. Part of it is good old-fashioned
discipline. You throw all of that into the stew. We talk a lot here about
grit and self-control. The kids know what those words mean.”

Levin walked down the hall to an eighth-grade math class and stood
quietly in the back. A student named Aaron was at the front of the class,
working his way through a problem from the page of thinking-skills
exercises that all KIPP students are required to do each morning. The
teacher, a ponytailed man in his thirties named Frank Corcoran, sat in a
chair to the side, only occasionally jumping in to guide the discussion. It
was the kind of scene repeated every day in American classrooms—with
one difference. Aaron was up at the front, working on that single
problem, for twenty minutes—methodically, carefully, with the
participation of the class, working his way through not just the answer
but also the question of whether there was more than one way to get the
answer. It was Renee painstakingly figuring out the concept of undefined
slope all over again.
“What that extra time does is allow for a more relaxed atmosphere,”
Corcoran said, after the class was over. “I find that the problem with
math education is the sink-or-swim approach. Everything is rapid fire,
and the kids who get it first are the ones who are rewarded. So there
comes to be a feeling that there are people who can do math and there
are people who aren’t math people. I think that extended amount of time
gives you the chance as a teacher to explain things, and more time for the
kids to sit and digest everything that’s going on—to review, to do things
at a much slower pace. It seems counterintuitive but we do things at a
slower pace and as a result we get through a lot more. There’s a lot more
retention, better understanding of the material. It lets me be a little bit
more relaxed. We have time to have games. Kids can ask any questions
they want, and if I’m explaining something, I don’t feel pressed for time.
I can go back over material and not feel time pressure.” The extra time
gave Corcoran the chance to make mathematics meaningful: to let his
students see the clear relationship between effort and reward.
On the walls of the classroom were dozens of certificates from the
New York State Regents exam, testifying to first-class honors for
Corcoran’s students. “We had a girl in this class,” Corcoran said. “She
was a horrible math student in fifth grade. She cried every Saturday
when we did remedial stuff. Huge tears and tears.” At the memory,
Corcoran got a little emotional himself. He looked down. “She just e-
mailed us a couple weeks ago. She’s in college now. She’s an accounting
major.”

The story of the miracle school that transforms losers into winners is, of
course, all too familiar. It’s the stuff of inspirational books and
sentimental Hollywood movies. But the reality of places like KIPP is a
good deal less glamorous than that. To get a sense of what 50 to 60
percent more learning time means, listen to the typical day in the life of a
KIPP student.
The student’s name is Marita. She’s an only child who lives in a
single-parent home. Her mother never went to college. The two of them
share a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx. Marita used to go to a
parochial school down the street from her home, until her mother heard
of KIPP. “When I was in fourth grade, me and one of my other friends,
Tanya, we both applied to KIPP,” Marita said. “I remember Miss Owens.
She interviewed me, and the way she was saying made it sound so hard I
thought I was going to prison. I almost started crying. And she was like,
If you don’t want to sign this, you don’t have to sign this. But then my
mom was right there, so I signed it.”
With that, her life changed. (Keep in mind, while reading what
follows, that Marita is twelve years old.)
“I wake up at five-forty-five a.m. to get a head start,” she says. “I
brush my teeth, shower. I get some breakfast at school, if I am running
late. Usually get yelled at because I am taking too long. I meet my
friends Diana and Steven at the bus stop, and we get the number one
bus.”
A 5:45 wakeup is fairly typical of KIPP students, especially given the
long bus and subway commutes that many have to get to school. Levin,
at one point, went into a seventh-grade music class with seventy kids in
it and asked for a show of hands on when the students woke up. A
handful said they woke up after six. Three quarters said they woke up
before six. And almost half said they woke up before 5:30. One
classmate of Marita’s, a boy named José, said he sometimes wakes up at
three or four a.m., finishes his homework from the night before, and then
“goes back to sleep for a bit.”
Marita went on:
I leave school at five p.m., and if I don’t lollygag around, then I
will get home around five-thirty. Then I say hi to my mom really

quickly and start my homework. And if it’s not a lot of homework
that day, it will take me two to three hours, and I’ll be done around
nine p.m. Or if we have essays, then I will be done like ten p.m.,
or ten-thirty p.m.
Sometimes my mom makes me break for dinner. I tell her I
want to go straight through, but she says I have to eat. So around
eight, she makes me break for dinner for, like, a half hour, and
then I get back to work. Then, usually after that, my mom wants to
hear about school, but I have to make it quick because I have to
get in bed by eleven p.m. So I get all my stuff ready, and then I get
into bed. I tell her all about the day and what happened, and by the
time we are finished, she is on the brink of sleeping, so that’s
probably around eleven-fifteen. Then I go to sleep, and the next
morning we do it all over again. We are in the same room. But it’s
a huge bedroom and you can split it into two, and we have beds on
other sides. Me and my mom are very close.
She spoke in the matter-of-fact way of children who have no way of
knowing how unusual their situation is. She had the hours of a lawyer
trying to make partner, or of a medical resident. All that was missing
were the dark circles under her eyes and a steaming cup of coffee, except
that she was too young for either.
“Sometimes I don’t go to sleep when I’m supposed to,” Marita
continued. “I go to sleep at, like, twelve o’clock, and the next afternoon,
it will hit me. And I will doze off in class. But then I have to wake up
because I have to get the information. I remember I was in one class, and
I was dozing off and the teacher saw me and said, ‘Can I talk to you after
class?’ And he asked me, ‘Why were you dozing off?’ And I told him I
went to sleep late. And he was, like, ‘You need to go to sleep earlier.’ ”
6.
Marita’s life is not the life of a typical twelve-year-old. Nor is it what we
would necessarily wish for a twelve-year-old. Children, we like to
believe, should have time to play and dream and sleep. Marita has
responsibilities. What is being asked of her is the same thing that was
asked of the Korean pilots. To become a success at what they did, they
had to shed some part of their own identity, because the deep respect for

authority that runs throughout Korean culture simply does not work in
the cockpit. Marita has had to do the same because the cultural legacy
she had been given does not match her circumstances either—not when
middle- and upper-middle-class families are using weekends and
summer vacation to push their children ahead. Her community does not
give her what she needs. So what does she have to do? Give up her
evenings and weekends and friends—all the elements of her old world—
and replace them with KIPP.
Here is Marita again, in a passage that is little short of heartbreaking:
Well, when we first started fifth grade, I used to have contact with
one of the girls from my old school, and whenever I left school on
Friday, I would go to her house and stay there until my mom
would get home from work. So I would be at her house and I
would be doing my homework. She would never have any
homework. And she would say, “Oh, my God, you stay there
late.” Then she said she wanted to go to KIPP, but then she would
say that KIPP is too hard and she didn’t want to do it. And I would
say, “Everyone says that KIPP is hard, but once you get the hang
of it, it’s not really that hard.” She told me, “It’s because you are
smart.” And I said, “No, every one of us is smart.” And she was so
discouraged because we stayed until five and we had a lot of
homework, and I told her that us having a lot of homework helps
us do better in class. And she told me she didn’t want to hear the
whole speech. All my friends now are from KIPP.
Is this a lot to ask of a child? It is. But think of things from Marita’s
perspective. She has made a bargain with her school. She will get up at
five-forty-five in the morning, go in on Saturdays, and do homework
until eleven at night. In return, KIPP promises that it will take kids like
her who are stuck in poverty and give them a chance to get out. It will
get 84 percent of them up to or above their grade level in mathematics.
On the strength of that performance, 90 percent of KIPP students get
scholarships to private or parochial high schools instead of having to
attend their own desultory high schools in the Bronx. And on the
strength of that high school experience, more than 80 percent of KIPP

graduates will go on to college, in many cases being the first in their
family to do so.
How could that be a bad bargain? Everything we have learned in
Outliers says that success follows a predictable course. It is not the
brightest who succeed. If it were, Chris Langan would be up there with
Einstein. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we
make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have
been given opportunities—and who have had the strength and presence
of mind to seize them. For hockey and soccer players born in January,
it’s a better shot at making the all-star team. For the Beatles, it was
Hamburg. For Bill Gates, the lucky break was being born at the right
time and getting the gift of a computer terminal in junior high. Joe Flom
and the founders of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz got multiple
breaks. They were born at the right time with the right parents and the
right ethnicity, which allowed them to practice takeover law for twenty
years before the rest of the legal world caught on. And what Korean Air
did, when it finally turned its operations around, was give its pilots the
opportunity to escape the constraints of their cultural legacy.
The lesson here is very simple. But it is striking how often it is
overlooked. We are so caught in the myths of the best and the brightest
and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth.
We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that
thirteen-year-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur. But
that’s the wrong lesson. Our world only allowed one thirteen-year-old
unlimited access to a time-sharing terminal in 1968. If a million
teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more
Microsofts would we have today? To build a better world we need to
replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that
today determine success—the fortunate birth dates and the happy
accidents of history—with a society that provides opportunities for all. If
Canada had a second hockey league for those children born in the last
half of the year, it would today have twice as many adult hockey stars.
Now multiply that sudden flowering of talent by every field and
profession. The world could be so much richer than the world we have
settled for.
Marita doesn’t need a brand-new school with acres of playing fields
and gleaming facilities. She doesn’t need a laptop, a smaller class, a
teacher with a PhD, or a bigger apartment. She doesn’t need a higher IQ

or a mind as quick as Chris Langan’s. All those things would be nice, of
course. But they miss the point. Marita just needed a chance. And look at
the chance she was given! Someone brought a little bit of the rice paddy
to the South Bronx and explained to her the miracle of meaningful work.

EPILOGUE
A Jamaican Story
“IF A PROGENY OF YOUNG COLORED CHILDREN IS BROUGHT FORTH,
THESE ARE EMANCIPATED.”
1.
On September 9, 1931, a young woman named Daisy Nation gave birth
to twin girls. She and her husband, Donald, were schoolteachers in a tiny
village called Harewood, in the central Jamaican parish of Saint
Catherine’s. They named their daughters Faith and Joyce. When Donald
was told that he had fathered twins, he sank down on his knees and
surrendered responsibility for their lives over to God.
The Nations lived in a small cottage on the grounds of Harewood’s
Anglican church. The schoolhouse was next door, a long, single-room
barn of a building raised on concrete stilts. On some days, there might be
as many as three hundred children in the room, and on others, less than
two dozen. The children would read out loud or recite their times tables.
Writing was done on slates. Whenever possible, the classes would move
outside, under the mango trees. If the children were out of control,
Donald Nation would walk from one end of the room to the other,
waving a strap from left to right as the children scrambled back to their
places.
He was an imposing man, quiet and dignified, and a great lover of
books. In his small library were works of poetry and philosophy and
novels by such writers as Somerset Maugham. Every day he would read
the newspaper closely, following the course of the events around the
world. In the evening, his best friend, Archdeacon Hay, the Anglican
pastor who lived on the other side of the hill, would come over and sit on
Donald’s veranda, and together they would expound on the problems of
Jamaica. Donald’s wife, Daisy, was from the parish of Saint Elizabeth.

Her maiden name was Ford, and her father had owned a small grocery
store. She was one of three sisters, and she was renowned for her beauty.
At the age of eleven, the twins won scholarships to a boarding school
called Saint Hilda’s near the north coast. It was an old Anglican private
school, established for the daughters of English clergy, property owners,
and overseers. From Saint Hilda’s they applied and were accepted to
University College, in London. Not long afterward, Joyce went to a
twenty-first-birthday party for a young English mathematician named
Graham. He stood up to recite a poem and forgot his lines, and Joyce
became embarrassed for him—even though it made no sense for her to
feel embarrassed, because she did not know him at all. Joyce and
Graham fell in love and got married. They moved to Canada. Graham
was a math professor. Joyce became a successful writer and a family
therapist. They had three sons and built a beautiful house on a hill, off in
the countryside. Graham’s last name is Gladwell. He is my father, and
Joyce Gladwell is my mother.
2.
That is the story of my mother’s path to success—and it isn’t true. It’s
not a lie in the sense that the facts were made up. But it is false in the
way that telling the story of Bill Gates without mentioning the computer
at Lakeside is false, or accounting for Asian math prowess without going
back to the rice paddies is false. It leaves out my mother’s many
opportunities and the importance of her cultural legacy.
In 1935, for example, when my mother and her sister were four, a
historian named William M. MacMillan visited Jamaica. He was a
professor at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South
Africa. MacMillan was a man before his time: he was deeply concerned
with the social problems of South Africa’s black population, and he came
to the Caribbean to make the same argument he had made back home in
South Africa.
Chief among MacMillan’s concerns was Jamaica’s educational
system. Formal schooling—if you could call what happened in the
wooden barn next door to my grandparents’ house “formal schooling”—
went only to fourteen years of age. Jamaica had no public high schools
or universities. Those with academic inclinations took extra classes with
the head teacher in their teenage years and with luck made it into

teachers’ college. Those with broader ambitions had to somehow find
their way into a private school, and from there to a university in the
United States or England.
But scholarships were few and far between, and the cost of private
schooling was prohibitive for all but a privileged few. The “bridge from
the primary schools” to high school, MacMillan later wrote, in a
blistering critique of England’s treatment of its colonies entitled Warning
from the West Indies, “is narrow and insecure.” The school system did
nothing for the “humblest” classes. He went on: “If anything these
schools are a factor deepening and sharpening social distinctions.” If the
government did not give its people opportunities, he warned, there would
be trouble.
A year after MacMillan published his book, a wave of riots and
unrest swept the Caribbean. Fourteen people were killed and fifty-nine
injured in Trinidad. Fourteen were killed and forty-seven injured in
Barbados. In Jamaica, a series of violent strikes shut down the country,
and a state of emergency was declared. Panicked, the British government
took MacMillan’s prescriptions to heart and, among other reforms,
proposed a series of “all-island” scholarships for academically minded
students to go to private high schools. The scholarships began in 1941.
My mother and her twin sister sat for the exam the following year. That
is how they got a high school education; had they been born two or three
or four years earlier, they might never have gotten a full education. My
mother owes the course her life took to the timing of her birth, to the
rioters of 1937, and to W. M. MacMillan.
I described Daisy Nation, my grandmother, as “renowned for her
beauty.” But the truth is that was a careless and condescending way to
describe her. She was a force. The fact that my mother and her sister left
Harewood for Saint Hilda’s was my grandmother’s doing. My
grandfather may have been an imposing and learned man, but he was an
idealist and a dreamer. He buried himself in his books. If he had
ambitions for his daughters, he did not have the foresight and energy to
make them real. My grandmother did. Saint Hilda’s was her idea: some
of the wealthier families in the area sent their daughters there, and she
saw what a good school meant. Her daughters did not play with the other
children of the village. They read. Latin and algebra were necessary for
high school, so she had her daughters tutored by Archdeacon Hay.

“If you’d asked her about her goals for her children, she would have
said she wanted us out of there,” my mother recalls. “She didn’t feel that
the Jamaican context offered enough. And if the opportunity was there to
go on, and you were able to take it, then to her the sky was the limit.”
When the results came back from the scholarship exam, only my aunt
was awarded a scholarship. My mother was not. That’s another fact that
my first history was careless about. My mother remembers her parents
standing in the doorway, talking to each other. “We have no more
money.” They had paid the tuition for the first term and bought the
uniforms and had exhausted their savings. What would they do when the
second-term fees for my mother came due? But then again, they couldn’t
send one daughter and not the other. My grandmother was steadfast. She
sent both—and prayed—and at the end of the first term, it turned out that
one of the other girls at the school had won two scholarships, so the
second was given to my mother.
When it came time to go to university, my aunt, the academic twin,
won what was called a Centenary Scholarship. The “Centenary” was a
reference to the fact that the scholarship was established one hundred
years after the abolition of slavery in Jamaica. It was reserved for the
graduates of public elementary schools, and, in a measure of how deeply
the British felt about honoring the memory of abolition, there was a total
of one Centenary scholarship awarded every year for the whole island,
with the prize going to the top girl and the top boy in alternating years.
The year my aunt applied was one of the “girl” years. She was lucky. My
mother was not. My mother was faced with the cost of passage to
England, room and board and living expenses, and tuition at the
University of London. To get a sense of how daunting that figure was,
the value of the Centenary scholarship my aunt won was probably as
much as the sum of my grandparents’ annual salaries. There were no
student loan programs, no banks with lines of credit for schoolteachers
out in the countryside. “If I’d asked my father,” my mother says, “he
would have replied, ‘We have no money.’ ”
What did Daisy do? She went to the Chinese shopkeeper in a
neighboring town. Jamaica has a very large Chinese population that
since the nineteenth century has dominated the commercial life of the
island. In Jamaican parlance, a store is not a store, it is a “Chinee-shop.”
Daisy went to the “Chinee-shop,” to Mr. Chance, and borrowed the
money. No one knows how much she borrowed, although it must have

been an enormous sum. And no one knows why Mr. Chance lent it to
Daisy, except of course that she was Daisy Nation, and she paid her bills
promptly and had taught the Chance children at Harewood School. It was
not always easy to be a Chinese child in a Jamaican schoolyard. The
Jamaican children would taunt the Chinese children. “Chinee nyan [eat]
dog.” Daisy was a kindly and beloved figure, an oasis amid that hostility.
Mr. Chance may have felt in her debt.
“Did she tell me what she was doing? I didn’t even ask her,” my
mother remembers. “It just occurred. I just applied to university and got
in. I acted completely on faith that I could rely on my mother, without
even realizing that I was relying on my mother.”
Joyce Gladwell owes her college education first to W. M. MacMillan,
and then to the student at Saint Hilda’s who gave up her scholarship, and
then to Mr. Chance, and then, most of all, to Daisy Nation.
3.
Daisy Nation was from the northwestern end of Jamaica. Her great-
grandfather was William Ford. He was from Ireland, and he arrived in
Jamaica in 1784 having bought a coffee plantation. Not long after his
arrival, he bought a slave woman and took her as his concubine. He
noticed her on the docks at Alligator Pond, a fishing village on the south
coast. She was an Igbo tribeswoman from West Africa. They had a son,
whom they named John. He was, in the language of the day, a “mulatto”;
he was colored—and all of the Fords from that point on fell into
Jamaica’s colored class.
In the American South during that same period, it would have been
highly unusual for a white landowner to have such a public relationship
with a slave. Sexual relations between whites and blacks were
considered morally repugnant. Laws were passed prohibiting
miscegenation, the last of which were not struck down by the US
Supreme Court until 1967. A plantation owner who lived openly with a
slave woman would have been socially ostracized, and any offspring
from the union of black and white would have been left in slavery.
In Jamaica, attitudes were very different. The Caribbean in those
years was little more than a massive slave colony. Blacks outnumbered
whites by a ratio of more than ten to one. There were few, if any,
marriageable white women, and as a result, the overwhelming majority

of white men in the West Indies had black or brown mistresses. One
British plantation owner in Jamaica who famously kept a precise diary of
his sexual exploits slept with 138 different women in his thirty-seven
years on the island, almost all of them slaves and, one suspects, not all of
them willing partners. And whites saw mulattoes—the children of those
relationships—as potential allies, a buffer between them and the
enormous numbers of slaves on the island. Mulatto women were prized
as mistresses, and their children, one shade lighter in turn, moved still
further up the social and economic ladder. Mulattoes rarely worked in the
fields. They lived the much easier life of working in the “house.” They
were the ones most likely to be freed. So many mulatto mistresses were
left substantial fortunes in the wills of white property owners that the
Jamaica legislature once passed a law capping bequests at two thousand
pounds (which, at the time, was an enormous sum).
“When a European arrives in the West Indies and gets settled or set
down for any length of time, he finds it necessary to provide himself
with a housekeeper or mistress,” one eighteenth-century observer wrote.
“The choice he has an opportunity of making is various, a black, a
tawney, a mulatto or a mestee, one of which can be purchased for 100 or
150 sterling…. If a progeny of young colored children is brought forth,
these are emancipated, and mostly sent by those fathers who can afford
it, at the age of three or four years, to be educated in England.”
This is the world Daisy’s grandfather John was born into. He was one
generation removed from a slave ship, living in a country best described
as an African penal colony, and he was a free man, with every benefit of
education. He married another mulatto, a woman who was half European
and half Arawak, which is the Indian tribe indigenous to Jamaica, and
had seven children.
“These people—the coloreds—had a lot of status,” the Jamaican
sociologist Orlando Patterson says. “By eighteen twenty-six, they had
full civil liberties. In fact, they achieve full civil liberties at the same
time as the Jews do in Jamaica. They could vote. Do anything a white
person could do—and this is within the context of what was still a slave
society.
“Ideally, they would try to be artisans. Remember, Jamaica has sugar
plantations, which are very different from the cotton plantations you find
in the American South. Cotton is a predominantly agricultural pursuit.
You are picking this stuff, and almost all of the processing was done in

Lancashire, or the North. Sugar is an agro-industrial complex. You have
to have the factory right there, because sugar starts losing sucrose within
hours of being picked. You had no choice but to have the sugar mill right
there, and sugar mills require a wide range of occupations. The coopers.
The boiler men. The carpenters—and a lot of those jobs were filled by
colored people.”
It was also the case that Jamaica’s English elite, unlike their
counterparts in the United States, had little interest in the grand project
of nation building. They wanted to make their money and go back to
England. They had no desire to stay in what they considered a hostile
land. So the task of building a new society—with the many opportunities
it embodied—fell to the coloreds as well.
“By eighteen fifty, the mayor of Kingston [the Jamaican capital] was
a colored person,” Patterson went on. “And so was the founder of the
Daily Gleaner [Jamaica’s major newspaper]. These were colored people,
and from very early on, they came to dominate the professional classes.
The whites were involved in business or the plantation. The people who
became doctors and lawyers were these colored people. These were the
people running the schools. The bishop of Kingston was a classic brown
man. They weren’t the economic elite. But they were the cultural elite.”
The chart below shows a breakdown of two categories of Jamaican
professionals—lawyers and members of parliament—in the early 1950s.
The categorization is by skin tone. “White and light” refers to people
who are either entirely white or, more likely, who have some black
heritage that is no longer readily apparent. “Olive” is one step below
that, and “light brown” one step below olive (although the difference
between those two shades might not be readily apparent to anyone but a
Jamaican). The fact to keep in mind is that in the 1950s “blacks” made
up about 80 percent of the Jamaican population, outnumbering coloreds
five to one.

Look at the extraordinary advantage that their little bit of whiteness
gave the colored minority. Having an ancestor who worked in the house
and not in the fields, who got full civil rights in 1826, who was valued
instead of enslaved, who got a shot at meaningful work instead of being
consigned to the sugarcane fields, made all the difference in occupational
success two and three generations later.
Daisy Ford’s ambition for her daughters did not come from nowhere,
in other words. She was the inheritor of a legacy of privilege. Her older
brother Rufus, with whom she went to live as a child, was a teacher and
a man of learning. Her brother Carlos went to Cuba and then came back
to Jamaica and opened a garment factory. Her father, Charles Ford, was a
produce wholesaler. Her mother, Ann, was a Powell, another educated,
upwardly mobile colored family—and the same Powells who would two
generations later produce Colin Powell. Her uncle Henry owned
property. Her grandfather John—the son of William Ford and his African
concubine—became a preacher. No less than three members of the
extended Ford family ended up winning Rhodes Scholarships. If my
mother owed W. M. MacMillan and the rioters of 1937 and Mr. Chance
and her mother, Daisy Ford, then Daisy owed Rufus and Carlos and Ann
and Charles and John.

My grandmother was a remarkable woman. But it is important to
remember that the steady upward path upon which the Fords embarked
began with a morally complicated act: William Ford looked upon my
great-great-great-grandmother with desire at a slave market in Alligator
Pond and purchased her.
The slaves who were not so chosen had short and unhappy lives. In
Jamaica, the plantation owners felt it made the most sense to extract the
maximum possible effort from their human property while the property
was still young—to work their slaves until they were either useless or
dead—and then simply buy another round at the market. They had no
trouble with the philosophical contradiction of cherishing the children
they had with a slave and simultaneously thinking of slaves as property.
Thomas Thistlewood, the plantation owner who cataloged his sexual

exploits, had a lifelong relationship with a slave named Phibbah, whom,
by all accounts, he adored, and who bore him a son. But to his “field”
slaves, he was a monster, whose preferred punishment for those who
tried to run away was what he called “Derby’s dose.” The runaway
would be beaten, and salt pickle, lime juice, and bird pepper would be
rubbed into his or her open wounds. Another slave would defecate into
the mouth of the miscreant, who would then be gagged for four to five
hours.
It is not surprising, then, that the brown-skinned classes of Jamaica
came to fetishize their lightness. It was their great advantage. They
scrutinized the shade of one another’s skin and played the color game as
ruthlessly in the end as the whites did. “If, as often happens, children are
of different shades of color in a family,” the Jamaican sociologist
Fernando Henriques once wrote:
the most lightly colored will be favored at the expense of the
others. In adolescence, and until marriage, the darker members of
the family will be kept out of the way when the friends of the fair
or fairer members of the family are being entertained. The fair
child is regarded as raising the color of the family and nothing
must be put in the way of its success, that is in the way of a
marriage which will still further raise the color status of the
family. A fair person will try to sever social relations he may have
with darker relatives… the darker members of a Negro family will
encourage the efforts of a very fair relative to “pass” for White.
The practices of intra-family relations lay the foundation for the
public manifestation of color prejudice.
My family was not immune to this. Daisy was inordinately proud of
the fact her husband was lighter than she was. But that same prejudice
was then turned on her: “Daisy’s nice, you know,” her mother-in-law
would say, “but she’s too dark.”
One of my mother’s relatives (I’ll call her Aunt Joan) was also well
up the color totem pole. She was “white and light.” But her husband was
what in Jamaica is called an “Injun”—a man with a dark complexion and
straight, fine black hair—and their daughters were dark like their father.
One day, after her husband had died, she was traveling on a train to visit

her daughter, and she met and took an interest in a light-skinned man in
the same railway car. What happened next is something that Aunt Joan
told only my mother, years later, with the greatest of shame. When she
got off the train, she walked right by her daughter, disowning her own
flesh and blood, because she did not want a man so light-skinned and
desirable to know that she had borne a daughter so dark.
In the 1960s, my mother wrote a book about her experiences. It was
entitled Brown Face, Big Master, the “brown face” referring to herself,
and the “big master” referring, in the Jamaican dialect, to God. At one
point, she describes a time just after my parents were married when they
were living in London and my eldest brother was still a baby. They were
looking for an apartment, and after a long search, my father found one in
a London suburb. On the day after they moved in, however, the landlady
ordered them out. “You didn’t tell me your wife was Jamaican,” she told
my father in a rage.
In her book, my mother describes her long struggle to make sense of
this humiliation, to reconcile her experience with her faith. In the end,
she was forced to acknowledge that anger was not an option and that as a
colored Jamaican whose family had benefited for generations from the
hierarchy of race, she could hardly reproach another for the impulse to
divide people by the shade of their skin:
I complained to God in so many words: “Here I was, the wounded
representative of the negro race in our struggle to be accounted
free and equal with the dominating whites!” And God was
amused; my prayer did not ring true with Him. I would try again.
And then God said, “Have you not done the same thing?
Remember this one and that one, people whom you have slighted
or avoided or treated less considerately than others because they
were different superficially, and you were ashamed to be
identified with them. Have you not been glad that you are not
more colored than you are? Grateful that you are not black?” My
anger and hate against the landlady melted. I was no better than
she was, nor worse for that matter…. We were both guilty of the
sin of self-regard, the pride and the exclusiveness by which we cut
some people off from ourselves.

It is not easy to be so honest about where we’re from. It would be
simpler for my mother to portray her success as a straightforward
triumph over victimhood, just as it would be simpler to look at Joe Flom
and call him the greatest lawyer ever—even though his individual
achievements are so impossibly intertwined with his ethnicity, his
generation, the particulars of the garment industry, and the peculiar
biases of the downtown law firms. Bill Gates could accept the title of
genius, and leave it at that. It takes no small degree of humility for him
to look back on his life and say, “I was very lucky.” And he was. The
Mothers’ Club of Lakeside Academy bought him a computer in 1968. It
is impossible for a hockey player, or Bill Joy, or Robert Oppenheimer, or
any other outlier for that matter, to look down from their lofty perch and
say with truthfulness, “I did this, all by myself.” Superstar lawyers and
math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear at first blush to lie
outside ordinary experience. But they don’t. They are products of history
and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not
exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and
inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain
lucky—but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the
end, is not an outlier at all.
My great-great-great-grandmother was bought at Alligator Pond. That
act, in turn, gave her son, John Ford, the privilege of a skin color that
spared him a life of slavery. The culture of possibility that Daisy Ford
embraced and put to use so brilliantly on behalf of her daughters was
passed on to her by the peculiarities of the West Indian social structure.
And my mother’s education was the product of the riots of 1937 and the
industriousness of Mr. Chance. These were history’s gifts to my family—
and if the resources of that grocer, the fruits of those riots, the
possibilities of that culture, and the privileges of that skin tone had been
extended to others, how many more would now live a life of fulfillment,
in a beautiful house high on a hill?

Outliers
The Story of Success
by
MALCOLM GLADWELL

A conversation with Malcolm Gladwell
What is an outlier?
“Outlier” is a scientific term to describe things or phenomena that lie
outside normal experience. In the summer, in Paris, we expect most days
to be somewhere between warm and very hot. But imagine if you had a
day in the middle of August when the temperature fell below freezing.
That day would be an outlier. And while we have a very good
understanding of why summer days in Paris are warm or hot, we know a
good deal less about why a summer day in Paris might be freezing cold.
In this book I’m interested in people who are outliers—in men and
women who, for one reason or another, are so accomplished and so
extraordinary and so outside of ordinary experience that they are as
puzzling to the rest of us as a cold day in August.
Why did you write Outliers?
I write books when I find myself returning again and again, in my mind,
to the same themes. I wrote Tipping Point because I was fascinated by
the sudden drop in crime in New York City—and that fascination grew
to an interest in the whole idea of epidemics and epidemic processes. I
wrote Blink because I began to get obsessed, in the same way, with how
all of us seem to make up our minds about other people in an instant—
without doing any real thinking.
In the case of Outliers, the book grew out of a frustration I found
myself having with the way we explain the careers of really successful
people. You know how you hear someone say of Bill Gates or some rock
star or some other outlier “They’re really smart” or “They’re really
ambitious”? Well, I know lots of people who are really smart and really
ambitious, and they aren’t worth 60 billion dollars. It struck me that our
understanding of success was really crude—and there was an
opportunity to dig down and come up with a better set of explanations.

In what way are our explanations of success “crude”?
That’s a bit of a puzzle because we certainly don’t lack for interest in the
subject. If you go to the bookstore, you can find a hundred success
manuals, or biographies of famous people, or self-help books that
promise to outline the six keys to great achievement. (Or is it seven?) So
we should be pretty sophisticated on the topic. What I came to realize in
writing Outliers, though, is that we’ve been far too focused on the
individual—on describing the characteristics and habits and personality
traits of those who get furthest ahead in the world. And that’s the
problem, because in order to understand outliers I think you have to look
around them—at their culture and community and family and generation.
We’ve been looking at tall trees, and I think we should have been
looking at the forest.
Can you give some examples?
Sure. For example, one of the chapters looks at the fact that a surprising
number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New
York City have almost the exact same biography: they are Jewish men,
born in the Bronx or Brooklyn in the mid-1930s to immigrant parents
who worked in the garment industry. Now, you can call that a
coincidence. Or you can ask—as I do—what is it about being Jewish and
being part of the generation born in the Depression and having parents
who worked in the garment business that might have something to do
with turning someone into a really, really successful lawyer? And the
answer is that you can learn a huge amount about why someone reaches
the top of that profession by asking those questions.
Doesn’t that make it sound like success is something outside of an
individual’s control?
I don’t mean to go that far. But I do think that we vastly underestimate
the extent to which success happens because of things the individual has
nothing to do with. Outliers opens, for example, by examining why a
hugely disproportionate number of professional hockey and soccer
players were born in January, February, and March. I’m not going to
spoil things for you by giving you the answer. But the point is that the
very best hockey players are people who are talented and work hard but

who also benefit from the weird and largely unexamined and peculiar
ways in which their world is organized.
I actually have a lot of fun with birthdates in Outliers. Did you know
that there’s a magic year to be born if you want to be a software
entrepreneur? And another magic year to be born if you want to be really
rich? In fact, one nine-year stretch turns out to have produced more
outliers than any other period in history. It’s remarkable how many
patterns you can find in the lives of successful people when you look
closely.
What’s the most surprising pattern you uncovered in the book?
It’s probably the chapter near the end of Outliers where I talk about
plane crashes. How good a pilot is, it turns out, has a lot to do with
where that pilot is from—that is, the culture he or she was raised in. I
was actually stunned by how strong the connection is between culture
and crashes, and it’s something that I would never have dreamed was
true in a million years.
Wait. Does this mean that there are some airlines that I should avoid?
Yes. Although, as I point out in Outliers, by acknowledging the role that
culture plays in piloting, some of the most unsafe airlines have actually
begun to clean up their act.
In The Tipping Point, you had an entire chapter on suicide. In Blink, you
ended the book with a long chapter on the Diallo shooting—and now
plane crashes. Do you have a macabre side?
Yes! I’m a frustrated thriller writer! But, seriously, there’s a good reason
for that. I think that we learn more from extreme circumstances than
anything else; disasters tell us something about the way we think and
behave that we can’t learn from ordinary life. That’s the premise of
Outliers. It’s those who lie outside ordinary experience who have the
most to teach us.
How does this book compare to Blink and The Tipping Point?
It’s different in the sense that it’s much more focused on people and their
stories. The subtitle—“The Story of Success”—is supposed to signal

that. A lot of the book is an attempt to describe the lives of successful
people, but to tell their stories in a different way than we’re used to. I
have a chapter that deals, in part, with explaining the extraordinary
success of Bill Gates. But I’m not interested in anything that happened to
him past the age of about seventeen. Or I have a chapter explaining why
Asian schoolchildren are so good at math. But it’s focused almost
entirely on what the grandparents and great-grandparents and great-
great-grandparents of those schoolchildren did for a living. You’ll meet
more people in Outliers than in my previous two books.
What was your most memorable experience in researching Outliers?
There were so many! I’ll never forget the time I spent with Chris
Langan, who might be the smartest man in the world. I’ve never been
able to feel someone’s intellect before, the way I could with him. It was
an intimidating experience, but also profoundly heartbreaking—as I hope
becomes apparent in “The Trouble with Geniuses” chapter. I also went to
southern China and hung out in rice paddies, and went to this weird little
town in eastern Pennsylvania where no one ever has a heart attack, and
deciphered aircraft “black box” recorders with crash investigators. I
should warn all potential readers that once you get interested in the world
of plane crashes, it becomes very hard to tear yourself away. I’m still
obsessed.
What do you want people to take away from Outliers?
I think this is the way in which Outliers is a lot like Blink and The
Tipping Point. They are all attempts to make us think about the world a
little differently. The hope with The Tipping Point was it would help the
reader understand that real change was possible. With Blink, I wanted to
get people to take the enormous power of their intuition seriously. My
wish with Outliers is that it makes us understand how much of a group
project success is. When outliers become outliers it is not just because of
their own efforts. It’s because of the contributions of lots of different
people and lots of different circumstances, and that means that we, as a
society, have more control about who succeeds—and how many of us
succeed—than we think. That’s an amazingly hopeful and uplifting idea.
I noticed that the book is dedicated to “Daisy.” Who is she?

Daisy is my grandmother. She was a remarkable woman who was
responsible for my mother’s success—for the fact that my mother was
able to get out of the little rural village in Jamaica where she grew up,
get a university education in England, and ultimately meet and marry my
father. The last chapter of Outliers is an attempt to understand how Daisy
was able to make that happen—using all the lessons learned over the
course of the book. I’ve never written something quite this personal
before. I hope readers find her story as moving as I did.

Questions and topics for discussion
1. Malcolm Gladwell argues that there’s no such thing as a self-made
man and that super achievers are successful because of their
circumstances, their families, and their appetite for hard work. How
is this view different from the way you have thought about and
understood success in the past?
2. In “The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes,” Gladwell discusses one
extreme way in which different “cultural languages” manifest
themselves. In your opinion, what is our “cultural language”? How
did it emerge and evolve? Does it work in our favor with regard to
our social structure?
3. Discuss what Gladwell means when he says that biologists often
talk about “the ‘ecology’ of an organism” (here). How is this similar
to “accumulative advantage” (here)?
4. Do you believe that there is such a thing as innate talent? What,
according to Gladwell, is the difference among talent, preparation,
and opportunity? What link does practice have to success?
5. Who are the “Termites” and why did they get this nickname? What,
in Gladwell’s opinion, was Terman’s error?
6. What does Gladwell think are some consequences of the way that
we have chosen to think about and personalize success? What
opportunities do we miss as a result? Do you think that as a society
we should revise our definition of success and how it is achieved?
7. In your opinion, is the 10,000-hour rule an encouraging or fatalistic
lens through which to view the possibility of individual success?
How does this rule alter our notion of the American Dream?

8. Gladwell writes about meritocracies influenced by advantages some
people have over others by virtue of opportunities, education, and
coaching. As the income gap in the United States continues to
widen, do you think that social mobility, which is an essential part
of achieving success, will continue to suffer?
9. Are there any outliers in your life? Who are they and what are their
stories? Has reading this book changed what you think of their
stories?

INTRODUCTION
John G. Bruhn and Stewart Wolf have published two books on their work in
Roseto: The Roseto Story (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1979)
and The Power of Clan: The Influence of Human Relationships on Heart
Disease (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1993). For a
comparison of Roseto Valfortore, Italy, and Roseto, Pennsylvania, USA, see
Carla Bianco, The Two Rosetos (Bloomington: Indiana University Press,
1974). Roseto might be unique among small Pennsylvania towns in the
degree of academic interest it has attracted.
ONE: THE MATTHEW EFFECT
Jeb Bush’s fantasies about being a self-made man are detailed in S. V.
Dáte’s Jeb: America’s Next Bush (New York: Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin,
2007), esp. pages 80–81. Dáte writes: “In both his 1994 and 1998 runs, Jeb
made it clear: not only was he not apologizing for his background, he was
proud of where he was financially, and certain that it was the result of his
own pluck and work ethic. ‘I’ve worked real hard for what I’ve achieved
and I’m quite proud of it,’ he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1993. ‘I have
no sense of guilt, no sense of wrongdoing.’
“The attitude was much the same as he had expressed on CNN’s Larry
King Live in 1992: ‘I think, overall, it’s a disadvantage,’ he said of being the
president’s son when it came to his business opportunities. ‘Because you’re
restricted in what you can do.’
“This thinking cannot be described as anything other than delusional.”
The Lethbridge Broncos, who were playing the day that Paula and Roger
Barnsley first noticed the relative-age effect, were a junior ice hockey team
in the Western Hockey League from 1974 until 1986. They won the WHL
Championship in 1982–83, and three years later were brought back to Swift
Current in Saskatchewan. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethbridge_Broncos.

Roger Barnsley and A. H. Thompson have put their study on a Web site,

Barnsley and his team branched out into other sports. See R. Barnsley, A. H.
Thompson, and Philipe Legault, “Family Planning: Football Style. The
Relative Age Effect in Football,” published in the International Review for
the Sociology of Sport 27, no. 1 (1992): 77–88.
The statistics for the relative-age effect in baseball come from Greg Spira, in
Slate magazine, http://www.slate.com/id/2188866/.
A. Dudink, at the University of Amsterdam, showed how the cutoff date for
English Premier League soccer creates the same age hierarchy as is seen in
Canadian hockey. See “Birth Date and Sporting Success,” Nature 368
(1994): 592.
Interestingly, in Belgium, the cutoff date for soccer used to be August 1, and
back then, almost a quarter of their top players were born in August and
September. But then the Belgian soccer federation switched to January 1,
and sure enough, within a few years, there were almost no elite soccer
players born in December, and an overwhelming number born in January.

(Boston: Beacon Press, 1982) includes a brilliant chapter on Jewish
immigrants to New York, to which I am heavily indebted.

SEVEN: THE ETHNIC THEORY OF PLANE CRASHES
The National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency that
investigates civil aviation accidents, published an Aircraft Accident Report
on the Korean Air 801 crash: NTSB/AAR-00/01.
The footnote about Three Mile Island draws heavily on the analysis of
Charles Perrow’s classic Normal Accidents: Living with High Risk
Technologies (New York: Basic Books, 1984).
The seven-errors-per-accident statistic was calculated by the National
Transportation Safety Board in a safety study titled “A Review of

Flightcrew-Involved Major Accidents of U.S. Air Carriers, 1978 Through
1990” (Safety Study NTSB/SS-94/01, 1994).

The unconscious impact of nationality on behavior was formally calculated
by Geert Hofstede and outlined in Culture’s Consequences: Comparing
Values, Behaviors, Institutions, and Organizations Across Nations
(Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications, 2001). The study of French and
German manufacturing plants that he quotes on page 102 was done by M.
Brossard and M. Maurice, “Existe-t-il un modèle universel des structures
d’organisation?,” Sociologie du Travail 16, no. 4 (1974): 482–495.
The application of Hofstede’s Dimensions to airline pilots was carried out
by Robert L. Helmreich and Ashleigh Merritt in “Culture in the Cockpit: Do
Hofstede’s Dimensions Replicate?,” Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology
31, no. 3 (May 2000): 283–301.

Priscilla Blinco’s study is entitled “Task Persistence in Japanese Elementary
Schools” and can be found in Edward Beauchamp, ed., Windows on
Japanese Education (New York: Greenwood Press, 1991).
NINE: MARITA’S BARGAIN

An article in the New York Times Magazine by Paul Tough, “What It Takes
to Make a Student” (November 26, 2006), examines the impact of the
government’s No Child Left Behind policy, the reasons for the education
gap, and the impact of charter schools such as KIPP.
Kenneth M. Gold, School’s In: The History of Summer Education in
American Public Schools (New York: Peter Lang, 2002), is an unexpectedly
fascinating account of the roots of the American school year.
Karl L. Alexander, Doris R. Entwisle, and Linda S. Olson’s study on the
impact of summer vacation is called “Schools, Achievement, and Inequality:
A Seasonal Perspective,” published in Education Evaluation and Policy
Analysis 23, no. 2 (Summer 2001): 171–191.
Much of the cross-national data comes from Michael J. Barrett’s “The Case
for More School Days,” published in the Atlantic Monthly in November
1990, p. 78.
EPILOGUE: A JAMAICAN STORY
William M. MacMillan details how his fears came to pass in the preface to
the second edition of Warning from the West Indies: A Tract for Africa and
the Empire (U.K.: Penguin Books, 1938).
The sexual exploits and horrific punishments of Jamaica’s white ruling class
are detailed by Trevor Burnard in Mastery, Tyranny and Desire: Thomas
Thistlewood and His Slaves in the Anglo-Jamaican World (Chapel Hill:
University of North Carolina Press, 2004).
The intermediary color class in the West Indies, not seen in the American
South, is described by Donald L. Horowitz in “Color Differentiation in the
American Systems of Slavery,” Journal of Interdisciplinary History 3, no.3
(Winter 1973): 509–541.
Population and employment statistics among the different-colored classes in
1950s Jamaica are taken from Leonard Broom’s essay “The Social
Differentiation of Jamaica,” American Sociological Review 19, no. 2 (April
1954): 115–125.
Divisions of color within families are explored by Fernando Henriques in
“Colour Values in Jamaican Society,” British Journal of Sociology 2, no. 2
(June 1951): 115–121.
Joyce Gladwell’s experiences as a black woman in the UK are from Brown
Face, Big Master (London: Inter-Varsity Press, 1969). It is a wonderful
book. I recommend it highly—although, as you can imagine, I could be a bit
biased.

Acknowledgments
I’m happy to say that Outliers conforms to its own thesis. It was very
much a collective effort. I was inspired, as I seem to always be, by the
work of Richard Nisbett. It was reading the Culture of Honor that set in
motion a lot of the thinking that led to this book. Thank you, Professor
Nisbett.
As always, I prevailed upon my friends to critique various drafts of
the manuscript. Happily, they complied, and Outliers is infinitely better
as a result. Many thanks to Jacob Weisberg, Terry Martin, Robert
McCrum, Sarah Lyall, Charles Randolph, Tali Farhadian, Zoe Rosenfeld,
and Bruce Headlam. Stacey Kalish and Sarah Kessler did yeoman’s work
in research and fact-checking. Suzy Hansen performed her usual editorial
magic. David Remnick graciously gave me time off from my duties at
The New Yorker to complete this book. Thank you, as always, David.
Henry Finder, my editor at The New Yorker, saved me from myself and
reminded me how to think, as he always does. I have worked with Henry
for so long that I now have what I like to call the “internal Finder,”
which is a self-correcting voice inside my head that gives me the benefit
of Henry’s wisdom even when he is not there. Both Finders—internal
and external—were invaluable.
Bill Phillips and I have been two for two so far, and I’m very grateful
I was able to enlist his Midas touch once more. Thank you, Bill. Here’s
hoping we go three for three. Will Goodlad and Stefan McGrath at
Penguin in England, and Michael Pietsch and—especially—Geoff
Shandler at Little, Brown saw this manuscript through, from start to
finish. Thanks to the rest of the team at Little, Brown as well: Heather
Fain and Heather Rizzo and Junie Dahn. My fellow Canadian Pamela
Marshall is a word wizard. I cannot imagine publishing a book without
her.
Two final words of appreciation. Tina Bennett, my agent, has been
with me from the very beginning. She is insightful and thoughtful and

encouraging and unfailingly wise, and when I think of what she has done
for me, I feel as lucky as a hockey player born on January 1.
I owe thanks most of all, though, to my parents, Graham and Joyce.
This is a book about the meaning of work, and I learned that work can be
meaningful from my father. Everything he does—from his most complex
academic mathematics to digging in the garden—he tackles with joy and
resolve and enthusiasm. My earliest memories of my father are of seeing
him work at his desk and realizing that he was happy. I did not know it
then, but that was one of the most precious gifts a father can give his
child. My mother, for her part, taught me how to express myself; she
taught me that there is beauty in saying something clearly and simply.
She read every word of this book and tried to hold me to that standard.
My grandmother Daisy, to whom Outliers is dedicated, gave my mother
the gift of opportunity. My mother has done the same for me.

Acclaim for Malcolm Gladwell’s
Outliers
The Story of Success
“On an eternal quest to explain us to ourselves, Malcolm Gladwell once
again turns his intellectual divining rod toward a common yet mysterious
cultural phenomenon—in this case, the lives of outliers, those
remarkable individuals whose success millions of us strive to duplicate.
What is the difference, Gladwell wonders, between those who do
something special with their lives and everyone else? From software
billionaires to professional athletes, Gladwell explains with his
trademark counterintuitive logic how the habits of highly successful
people pale in importance to where, when, and how you were raised….
As always, insights guaranteed to comfort and discomfort equally.”
—Elissa Schappell, Vanity Fair
“In the vast world of nonfiction writing, Malcolm Gladwell is as close to
a singular talent as exists today…. Outliers is a pleasure to read and
leaves you mulling over its inventive theories for days afterward….
Outliers represents a new kind of book for Gladwell…. It is almost a
manifesto.”
—David Leonhardt, New York Times Book Review
“Unabashedly inspiring…. A provocative and practical book about the
landscape of success.”
—Jonah Raskin, San Francisco Chronicle
“A must-read for educators, recruiters, and parents…. Outliers is
evidence of Mr. Gladwell’s 10,000 hours.”
—Joanne McNeil, Sunday Times
“An important new book…. Gladwell intelligently captures a larger
tendency of thought—the growing appreciation of the power of cultural
patterns, social contagions, memes…. Gladwell’s social determinism is a
useful corrective to the Homo economicus view of human nature.”

—David Brooks, New York Times
“Outliers is a compelling read with an important message: by
understanding better what makes people successful we should be able to
produce more successful (and happy) people.”
—Economist
“The explosively entertaining Outliers might be Gladwell’s best and
most useful work yet…. There are both brilliant yarns and life lessons
here: Outliers is riveting science, self-help, and entertainment, all in one
book.”
—Gregory Kirschling, Entertainment Weekly
“No other book I read this year combines such a distinctive prose style
with truly thought-provoking content. Gladwell somehow writes with a
high degree of dazzle but at the same time remains as clear and direct as
even Strunk or White could hope for.”
—Frank Reiss, Atlanta Journal-Constitution
“A fascinating and entertaining book, one that exposes the rarely
acknowledged forces behind success.”
—James F. Sweeney, Cleveland Plain Dealer
“Gladwell’s points are well worth pondering.”
—Business Week
“Insightful…. If enough people read and ponder the implications of
Outliers, perhaps that can help begin the much needed process of turning
around current counterproductive attitudes toward education and toward
life.”
—Thomas Sowell, Washington Times
“Malcolm Gladwell has a rare ability: he can transform academic
research into engaging fables spotlighting real people…. Outliers, with
its entertaining psychology and sociology, is catchy and beautifully
written.”
—Stephen Kotkin, New York Times
“It’s hard to resist Malcolm Gladwell…. Reading one of his books is like
sitting at the kitchen table while he runs about his house, pulling research

studies out of file cabinets, thick biographies off bookshelves, and
spreadsheets from his laptop. ‘Check this out!’ he exclaims, and ‘Can
you believe this one?!’ Then he gets serious. ‘You know how important
this is, don’t you?’ he asks…. Ultimately, Outliers is a book about the
twentieth century. It offers a fascinating look at how certain people
become successful.”
—Rebecca Steinitz, Boston Globe
“Thought-provoking, entertaining, and irresistibly debatable…. Outliers
is another winner from this agile social observer.”
—Heller McAlpin, Christian Science Monitor
“Gladwell’s writing is always accessible and attractive, and his ideas—
culled from science, brimming with research—are fascinating.”
—Margaret Sullivan, Buffalo News
“Gladwell turns conventional wisdom on its head…. With his knack for
spotting curious findings in the social sciences, he stands out among
contemporary writers…. Gladwell reveals his special genius in this
remarkable trilogy completed by Outliers…. It is in spotting remarkable
jewels in the vast rock collection of social-science research and placing
them expertly into an exquisite setting.”
—Howard Gardner, Washington Post
“As in Blink and The Tipping Point, the anecdotes are dazzling and the
data uncanny.”
—Max Ross, Minneapolis Star Tribune
“No other writer today can pull this sort of thing off so well. If I hadn’t
just read Gladwell’s book, I’d be jealous of his talent, instead of his
luck.”
—Jerry Adler, Newsweek
“An insightful book…. Required reading for anyone interested in the
psychology of achievement.”
—Connie Glaser, Atlanta Business Chronicle
“The thrust of Mr. Gladwell’s argument is right on target…. He
passionately emphasizes the need to cultivate great minds that might be

limited by their circumstances or environment.”
—David A. Shaywitz, Wall Street Journal
“Downright entertaining and informative…. Malcolm Gladwell makes us
think. Is there any finer compliment for an author?”
—Al Hutchison, Tampa Tribune
“Readable and entertaining…. Malcolm Gladwell is a successful
practitioner of what we might think of as a new wave of social science—
sociology, economics, psychology, history—for a general readership….
The success stories Gladwell relates are inspiring, and the tales of
success, whether about hockey players, computer geniuses, corporate
lawyers, or entrepreneurs, are narrated expertly.”
—Crispin Sartwell, Philadelphia Inquirer
“Thought-provoking…. Gladwell roves widely, anecdotally, and always
readably…. The book’s miscellany of information and individuals
entertains.”
—New Scientist
“Outliers is probably Malcolm Gladwell’s most important book yet….
Gladwell gives you a new way of seeing the world.”
—Michael Bond, Nature Magazine
“Gladwell’s unique perspective challenges readers to think about
intelligence, success, and fame in a new way…. Outliers is a clever,
entertaining book that stimulates readers’ minds and broadens their
perspectives. It is, in its own way, genius.”
—John T. Slania, BookPage
“Outliers will sell jillions of copies in the time it takes you to read this
paragraph. And while thousands of its readers will be business students
and corporate executives looking for Gladwell to demystify the
incomprehensible behavior of human beings for them, the target
audience for Outliers could just as well be very anxious parents in
America.”
—Joel Lovell, GQ

“With Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell has done it again: taken what might
have been a dry and pedantic subject and instead produced an enjoyable,
almost breezy, treatise on the exceptional… illuminated with the minute-
yet-telling details that mark Gladwell’s best work.”
—Scott Coffman, Louisville Courier-Journal
“Gladwell knows how to spin a yarn from what might otherwise be dry
sociological and psychological studies by weaving in anecdotes and
interviews that illustrate his theories on how to maximize human
potential.”
—Michelle Archer, USA Today
“I like the way Malcolm Gladwell makes me think…. Gladwell uses his
special brand of pop sociology and a collection of intriguing anecdotes to
postulate that timing has as much to do with success as grit and brains.”
—Susan Reimer, Baltimore Sun
“Gladwell once again proves masterful in a genre he essentially
pioneered—the book that illuminates secret patterns behind everyday
phenomena…. Gladwell tears down the myth of individual merit to
explore how culture, circumstance, timing, birth, and luck account for
success—and how historical legacies can hold others back despite ample
individual gifts. Even as we know how many of these stories end,
Gladwell restores the suspense and serendipity to these narratives that
make them fresh and surprising.”
—Publishers Weekly
“Outliers is a provocative and stimulating book, a pleasure to read for its
clear prose and its vigorous intelligence. Gladwell’s timing is once again
impeccable, and with the benefit of his good Canadian education, he’s
equipped to share his grasp of zeitgeist with an audience eager for
enlightenment.”
—John Strawn, Portland Oregonian

* The way Canadians select hockey players is a beautiful example of what the sociologist Robert
Merton famously called a “self-fulfilling prophecy”—a situation where “a false definition, in the
beginning… evokes a new behavior which makes the original false conception come true.”
Canadians start with a false definition of who the best nine- and ten-year-old hockey players are.
They’re just picking the oldest every year. But the way they treat those “all-stars” ends up
making their original false judgment look correct. As Merton puts it: “This specious validity of
the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course
of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.”

* A physically immature basketball player in an American city can probably play as many hours
of basketball in a given year as a relatively older child because there are so many basketball
courts and so many people willing to play. It’s not like ice hockey, where you need a rink.
Basketball is saved by its accessibility and ubiquity.

* Even more social phenomena can be linked to relative age. Barnsley and two colleagues, for
instance, once found that students who attempt suicide are also more likely to be born in the
second half of the school year. Their explanation is that poorer school performance can lead to
depression. The connection between relative age and suicide, however, isn’t nearly as pronounced
as the correlation between birth date and athletic success.

* The sociologist C. Wright Mills made an additional observation about that special cohort from
the 1830s. He looked at the backgrounds of the American business elite from the Colonial Era to
the twentieth century. In most cases, not surprisingly, he found that business leaders tended to
come from privileged backgrounds. The one exception? The 1830s group. That shows how big
the advantage was of being born in that decade. It was the only time in American history when
those born in modest circumstances had a realistic shot at real riches. He writes: “The best time
during the history of the United States for the poor boy ambitious for high business success to
have been born was around the year 1835.”

* The super IQ test was created by Ronald K. Hoeflin, who is himself someone with an unusually
high IQ. Here’s a sample question, from the verbal analogies section. “Teeth is to Hen as Nest is
to?” If you want to know the answer, I’m afraid I have no idea.

* To get a sense of what Chris Langan must have been like growing up, consider the following
description of a child named “L,” who had an IQ in the same 200 range as Langan’s. It’s from a
study by Leta Stetter Hollingworth, who was one of the first psychologists to study exceptionally
gifted children. As the description makes obvious, an IQ of 200 is really, really high: “Young L’s
erudition was astonishing. His passion for scholarly accuracy and thoroughness set a high
standard for accomplishment. He was relatively large, robust and impressive, and was fondly
dubbed ‘Professor.’ His attitudes and abilities were appreciated by both pupils and teachers. He
was often allowed to lecture (for as long as an hour) on some special topic, such as the history of
timepieces, ancient theories of engine construction, mathematics, and history. He constructed out
of odds and ends (typewriter ribbon spools, for example) a homemade clock of the pendular type
to illustrate some of the principles of chronometry, and this clock was set up before the class
during the enrichment unit on ‘Time and Time Keeping’ to demonstrate some of the principles of
chronometry. His notebooks were marvels of scholarly exposition.
“Being discontented with what he considered the inadequate treatment of land travel in a
class unit on ‘Transportation,’ he agreed that time was too limited to do justice to everything. But
he insisted that ‘at least they should have covered ancient theory.’ As an extra and voluntary
project, ‘he brought in elaborate drawings and accounts of the ancient theories of engines,
locomotives etc.’… He was at that time 10 years of age.”

* The answer is that a round manhole cover can’t fall into the manhole, no matter how much you
twist and turn it. A rectangular cover can: All you have to do is tilt it sideways. There: now you
can get a job at Microsoft.

* The “IQ fundamentalist” Arthur Jensen put it thusly in his 1980 book Bias in Mental Testing (p.
113): “The four socially and personally most important threshold regions on the IQ scale are
those that differentiate with high probability between persons who, because of their level of
general mental ability, can or cannot attend a regular school (about IQ 50), can or cannot master
the traditional subject matter of elementary school (about IQ 75), can or cannot succeed in the
academic or college preparatory curriculum through high school (about IQ 105), can or cannot
graduate from an accredited four-year college with grades that would qualify for admission to a
professional or graduate school (about IQ 115). Beyond this, the IQ level becomes relatively
unimportant in terms of ordinary occupational aspirations and criteria of success. That is not to
say that there are not real differences between the intellectual capabilities represented by IQs of
115 and 150 or even between IQs of 150 and 180. But IQ differences in this upper part of the
scale have far less personal implications than the thresholds just described and are generally of
lesser importance for success in the popular sense than are certain traits of personality and
character.”

* Just to be clear: it is still the case that Harvard produces more Nobel Prize winners than any
other school. Just look at those lists. Harvard appears on both of them, a total of three times. A
school like Holy Cross appears just once. But wouldn’t you expect schools like Harvard to win
more Nobels than they do? Harvard is, after all, the richest, most prestigious school in history and
has its pick of the most brilliant undergraduates the world over.

* To get a sense of how absurd the selection process at elite Ivy League schools has become,
consider the following statistics. In 2008, 27,462 of the most highly qualified high school seniors
in the world applied to Harvard University. Of these students, 2,500 of them scored a perfect 800
on the SAT critical reading test and 3,300 had a perfect score on the SAT math exam. More than
3,300 were ranked first in their high school class. How many did Harvard accept? About 1,600,
which is to say they rejected 93 out of every 100 applicants. Is it really possible to say that one
student is Harvard material and another isn’t, when both have identical—and perfect—academic
records? Of course not. Harvard is being dishonest. Schwartz is right. They should just have a
lottery.

* Here’s another student’s answers. These might be even better than Poole’s: “(Brick). To break
windows for robbery, to determine depth of wells, to use as ammunition, as pendulum, to practice
carving, wall building, to demonstrate Archimedes’ Principle, as part of abstract sculpture, cosh,
ballast, weight for dropping things in river, etc., as a hammer, keep door open, footwiper, use as
rubble for path filling, chock, weight on scale, to prop up wobbly table, paperweight, as
firehearth, to block up rabbit hole.”

* Most estimates put the heritability of IQ at roughly 50 percent.

* The lawyer and novelist Louis Auchincloss, who very much belongs to the old WASP-y white-
shoe legal establishment in New York, has a scene in his book The Scarlet Letters that perfectly
captures the antipathy the downtown firms felt toward takeover law. “Face it, my dear, your
husband and I are running a firm of shysters,” a takeover attorney explains to the wife of his law
partner.
He continues: “Nowadays when one wishes to acquire a company that doesn’t wish to be
acquired, one’s counsel bring all kinds of nuisance suits to induce it to change its mind. We sue
for mismanagement by the directors, for unpaid dividends, for violation of the bylaws, for
improper issuance of stock. We allege criminal misconduct; we shout about antitrust; we sue for
ancient and dubious liabilities. And our opponent’s counsel will answer with inordinate demands
for all our files and seek endless interrogatories in order to enmesh our client in a hopeless tangle
of red tape…. It is simply war, and you know the quality that applies to that and love.”

* The best analysis of how adversity turned into opportunity for Jewish lawyers has been done by
the legal scholar Eli Wald. Wald is careful to make the point, however, that Flom and his ilk
weren’t merely lucky. Lucky is winning the lottery. They were given an opportunity, and they
seized it. As Wald says: “Jewish lawyers were lucky and they helped themselves. That’s the best
way to put it. They took advantage of the circumstances that came their way. The lucky part was
the unwillingness of the WASP firms to step into takeover law. But that word luck fails to capture
the work and the efforts and the imagination and the acting on opportunities that might have been
hidden and not so obvious.”

* Janklow and Nesbit, the agency he started, is, in fact, my literary agency. That is how I heard
about Janklow’s family history.

* I realize that it seems strange to refer to American Jewish immigrants as lucky when the
families and relatives they left behind in Europe were on the verge of extermination at the hands
of the Nazis. Borgenicht, in fact, unwittingly captures this poignancy in his memoir, which was
published in 1942. He called it The Happiest Man. After numerous chapters brimming with
optimism and cheer, the book ends with the sobering reality of Nazi-dominated Europe. Had The
Happiest Man been published in 1945, when the full story of the Holocaust was known, one
imagines it would have had a very different title.

* Just to be clear: to say that garment work was meaningful is not to romanticize it. It was
incredibly hard and often miserable labor. The conditions were inhuman. One survey in the 1890s
put the average workweek at eighty-four hours, which comes to twelve hours a day. At times, it
was higher. “During the busy season,” David Von Drehle writes in Triangle: The Fire That
Changed Amierca, “it was not unusual to find workers on stools or broken chairs, bent over their
sewing or hot irons, from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., a hundred or more hours a week. Indeed, it was said
that during the busy seasons the grinding hum of sewing machines never entirely ceased on the
Lower East Side, day or night.”

* The conventional explanation for Jewish success, of course, is that Jews come from a literate,
intellectual culture. They are famously “the people of the book.” There is surely something to
that. But it wasn’t just the children of rabbis who went to law school. It was the children of
garment workers. And their critical advantage in climbing the professional ladder wasn’t the
intellectual rigor you get from studying the Talmud. It was the practical intelligence and savvy
you get from watching your father sell aprons on Hester Street.

* David Hackett Fischer’s book Albion’s Seed: Four British Folkways in America is the most
definitive and convincing treatment of the idea that cultural legacies cast a long historical
shadow. (If you read my first book, The Tipping Point, you’ll remember that the discussion of
Paul Revere was drawn from Fischer’s Paul Revere’s Ride.) In Albion’s Seed, Fischer argues that
there were four distinct British migrations to America in its first 150 years: first the Puritans, in
the 1630s, who came from East Anglia to Massachusetts; then the Cavaliers and servants, who
came from southern England to Virginia in the mid-seventeenth century; then the Quakers, from
the North Midlands to the Delaware Valley between the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries; and finally, the people of the borderlands to the Appalachian interior in the eighteenth
century. Fischer argues brilliantly that those four cultures—each profoundly different—
characterize those four regions of the United States even to this day.

* Cohen has done other experiments looking again for evidence of “southernness,” and each time
he finds the same thing. “Once, we bothered students with persistent annoyances,” he said. “They
come into the lab and they are supposed to draw pictures from their childhood. They are doing
this with the confederate, and he’s being a jerk. He does all these things to persistently annoy the
subject. He’ll wad up his drawing and throw it at the wastebasket and hit the subject. He’ll steal
the subject’s crayons and not give them back. He keeps on calling the subject ‘Slick,’ and he
says, ‘I’m going to put your name on your drawing,’ and writes ‘Slick.’ What you find is that
northerners tend to give off displays of anger, up to a certain point, at which point they level off.
Southerners are much less likely to be angry early on. But at some point they catch up to the
northerners and shoot past them. They are more likely to explode, much more volatile, much
more explosive.”

* How are these kinds of attitudes passed down from generation to generation? Through social
heritance. Think of the way accents persist over time. David Hackett Fischer points out that the
original settlers of Appalachia said: “whar for where, thar for there, hard for hired, critter for
creature, sartin for certain, a-goin for going, hit for it, he-it for hit, far for fire, deef for deaf, pizen
for poison, nekkid for naked, eetch for itch, boosh for bush, wrassle for wrestle, chaw for chew,
poosh for push, shet for shut, ba-it for bat, be-it for be, narrer for narrow, winder for window,
widder for widow, and young-uns for young one.” Recognize that? It’s the same way many rural
people in the Appalachians speak today. Whatever mechanism passes on speech patterns
probably passes on behavioral and emotional patterns as well.

* Korean Air was called Korean Airlines before it changed its name after the Guam accident.
And the Barents Sea incident was actually preceded by two other crashes, in 1971 and 1976.

* This is true not just of plane crashes. It’s true of virtually all industrial accidents. One of the
most famous accidents in history, for example, was the near meltdown at Pennsylvania’s Three
Mile Island nuclear station in 1979. Three Mile Island so traumatized the American public that it
sent the US nuclear power industry into a tailspin from which it has never fully recovered. But
what actually happened at that nuclear reactor began as something far from dramatic. As the
sociologist Charles Perrow shows in his classic Normal Accidents, there was a relatively routine
blockage in what is called the plant’s “polisher”—a kind of giant water filter. The blockage
caused moisture to leak into the plant’s air system, inadvertently tripping two valves and shutting
down the flow of cold water into the plant’s steam generator. Like all nuclear reactors, Three
Mile Island had a backup cooling system for precisely this situation. But on that particular day,
for reasons that no one really understands, the valves for the backup system weren’t open.
Someone had closed them, and an indicator in the control room showing they were closed was
blocked by a repair tag hanging from a switch above it. That left the reactor dependent on another
backup system, a special sort of relief valve. But, as luck would have it, the relief valve wasn’t
working properly that day either. It stuck open when it was supposed to close, and, to make
matters even worse, a gauge in the control room that should have told the operators that the relief
valve wasn’t working was itself not working. By the time Three Mile Island’s engineers realized
what was happening, the reactor had come dangerously close to a meltdown.
No single big thing went wrong at Three Mile Island. Rather, five completely unrelated
events occurred in sequence, each of which, had it happened in isolation, would have caused no
more than a hiccup in the plant’s ordinary operation.

* We know this because the flight attendant survived the crash and testified at the inquest.

* Hofstede, similarly, references a study done a few years ago that compared German and French
manufacturing plants that were in the same industry and were roughly the same size. The French
plants had, on average, 26 percent of their employees in management and specialist positions; the
Germans, 16 percent. The French, furthermore, paid their top management substantially more
than the Germans did. What we are seeing in that comparison, Hofstede argued, is a difference in
cultural attitudes toward hierarchy. The French have a power distance index twice that of the
Germans. They require and support hierarchy in a way the Germans simply don’t.

* Here are the top five pilot PDIs by country. If you compare this list to the ranking of plane
crashes by country, they match up very closely.
1. Brazil
2. South Korea
3. Morocco
4. Mexico
5. Philippines
The five lowest pilot PDIs by country are:
15. United States
16. Ireland
17. South Africa
18. Australia
19. New Zealand

* On international comparison tests, students from Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore,
and Taiwan all score roughly the same in math, around the ninety-eighth percentile. The United
States, France, England, Germany, and the other Western industrialized nations cluster at
somewhere between the twenty-six and thirty-sixth percentile. That’s a big difference.

† Lynn’s claim that Asians have higher IQs has been refuted, convincingly, by a number of other
experts, who showed that he based his argument on IQ samples drawn disproportionately from
urban, upper-income homes. James Flynn, perhaps the world’s leading expert on IQ, has
subsequently made a fascinating counterclaim. Asians’ IQs, he says, have historically been
slightly lower than whites’ IQs, meaning that their dominance in math has been in spite of their
IQ, not because of it. Flynn’s argument was outlined in his book Asian Americans: Achievement
Beyond IQ (1991).

* Two small points. Mainland China isn’t on this list because China doesn’t yet take part in the
TIMSS study. But the fact that Taiwan and Hong Kong rank so highly suggests that the mainland
would probably also do really well.
Second, and perhaps more important, what happens in the north of China, which isn’t a wet-
rice agriculture society but historically a wheat-growing culture, much like Western Europe? Are
they good at math too? The short answer is that we don’t know. The psychologist James Flynn
points out, though, that the overwhelming majority of Chinese immigrants to the West—the
people who have done so well in math here—are from South China. The Chinese students
graduating at the top of their class at MIT are the descendants, chiefly, of people from the Pearl
River Delta. He also points out that the lowest-achieving Chinese Americans are the so-called
Sze Yap people, who come from the edges of the Delta, “where soil was less fertile and
agriculture less intense.”

† There is actually a significant scientific literature measuring Asian “persistence.” In a typical
study, Priscilla Blinco gave large groups of Japanese and American first graders a very difficult
puzzle and measured how long they worked at it before they gave up. The American children
lasted, on average, 9.47 minutes. The Japanese children lasted 13.93 minutes, roughly 40 percent
longer.
